Alyssum,Cover Crop,Direct sow when a slight risk of frost still exists,"Sow seeds on the surface of the soil. They should sprout in 5 to 14 days, depending on conditions.",Alyssum can be tilled under or cut and composted at the end of the season. Avoid following this cover crop with other Brassicas. Excess moisture in the soil causes Alyssum to grow very vigorously.,
Buckwheat,Cover Crop,Sow from 2-4 weeks after the last frost date through the end of August. Frost will kill this half-hardy annual.,"Sow seeds 2-4cm (1-1½"") deep.","Within ten days of blooming (or at any time before), buckwheat can be cut and turned under to improve soil tilth and add organic matter. The plants can be worked into the soil easily with a garden fork. The succulent plant matter decomposes quickly. Wait two weeks to plant the following crop.",
Clover,Cover Crop,Plant any time between the last frost date and early autumn.,"Sow seeds no deeper than 5mm (¼"").","For nitrogen fixation, allow the plants to reach flowering stage. Clover spreads by underground runners that call for more thorough tillage in the spring. A simple garden fork works well for this purpose. Allow two weeks for this clover to break down in the soil before planting the next crop.",
Hairy Vetch,Cover Crop,Plant any time between the last frost date and early autumn.,"Sow seeds no deeper than 5mm (¼"").","For nitrogen fixation, allow the plants to reach flowering stage. Clover spreads by underground runners that call for more thorough tillage in the spring. A simple garden fork works well for this purpose. Allow two weeks for this clover to break down in the soil before planting the next crop.",
Oats,Cover Crop,"The fast growth of this soil builder makes it ideal for sowing in the spring for erosion control or quick tilling. Planted in August, oats will put on a lot of growth and, in most winters, will be killed by frost. Hardy to Zone 8: -12°C (-10°F).","Sow to a depth of 2-4cm (1-1½"").","Oats are less weedy and tenacious than fall rye, and are easily worked into the soil with a garden fork. Allow two weeks before planting the next crop.",
Rye,Cover Crop,Plant fall rye 6-8 weeks before the first frost date for best results. The seeds will germinate as late as early November. A spring crop can be planted March through April. Hardy to Zone 3: -40°C (-40°F).,"Sow seeds 2-4cm (1-1½"") deep.","After its burst of spring growth, turn rye under or cut it back before it reaches 30cm (12"") tall. Allow three weeks after tilling before planting the next crop.",
Wheat,Cover Crop,"Sow 6-8 weeks before the first average frost date. Winter wheat is hardy to Zone 3: -40°C (-40°F). Unlike oats, this cold-hardy cereal will not die off over winter.","Sow to a depth of 2cm (1"").","The germinated seeds lie dormant in frosty soil, and then burst into growth in the spring, providing a greater nitrogen to carbon ratio when it is tilled under. Left to mature, it will produce hard wheat kernels by early summer. Till at any time, using a fork to properly integrate the organic matter into the soil.",
Aurinia,Flower,"Indoors, start Aurinia seeds 8-10 weeks before planting out. Or direct sow in early spring, when there is still a risk of frost, or in early autumn.",Sow seeds on the surface of the soil. Light is required to help the seeds break their dormancy. At 10-12°C (50-55°F) Aurinia seeds will take 5 to 14 days to sprout.,"If transplanting from indoor starts, do so in early spring when the soil is still cool, but the threat of frost has passed. Daytime temperatures should be steadily above 10°C (50°F). Space plants around 30cm (12″) apart in full sun, in well-drained soil. Aurinia plants will become leggy in rich soil, so do not feed. Water plants in periods of very dry weather. Cut plants back hard after flowering to prevent self sowing.",
Agastache,Flower,"Sow indoors in late winter, before the last frost date. Transplant once night time temperatures are steadily above 10°C (50°F). Otherwise, direct sow in autumn. Optimal soil temperature: 12°C (55°F).","Just cover the seeds, and keep moist in a sterile seed starting mix. When no risk of frost is left, transplant outdoors to containers or at 30cm (12″) spacing in the garden.","Provide some balanced organic fertilizer annually in the spring. Grow in well drained, fairly rich soil in full sun. Agastache can tolerate light shade, but will not perform as well. Maintain vigorous plants by dividing in the fall. Plants grown from seed may take two years to bloom.",
Amaranth,Flower,"Start indoors four weeks before the last frost to late spring. Transplant in 5-6 weeks. Direct seed when temperatures are reliably above 10°C (50°F). Overwintering types are started in July where winters are mild, and transplanted by mid-August. Optimal soil temperature: 10-30°C (50-85°F). Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days.",Sow 3-4 seeds 5mm (¼”) deep in each spot you want a plant to grow. Thin to the strongest plant. Space transplants 45-60cm (18-24″) apart in rows 60-90cm (24-36″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8.Humus-rich soil amended with composted manure is best. Mix ½ cup of complete organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant. From seedling to harvest, cauliflower must grow steadily to make a large plant and curd. If growth slows, scratch additional fertilizer into the surface of the soil around each plant. Maintain even soil moisture with regular watering. Shade the developing curds from sun by tying up leaves or using newspaper. This is known as “blanching,” and will keep them white. Add 20-25 days to the maturity dates if direct sowing. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions, at least 80% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 200 seeds, per acre: 44M seeds.","Once curd forms, check every day and cut when the florets are just beginning to separate. At this point the flavour is at peak quality and the size is maximum."
Ammi,Flower,"Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost. Transplants can go out 3-4 weeks after last frost, or once the daytime temperatures are steadily above 10°C (50°F). Or direct sow outdoors in early spring when the soil is still cool and a light frost is still a possibility. Ammi can also be direct sown in late autumn. Seeds should germinate in 7-25 days.","Just cover the small seeds. If starting indoors, wrap planted seedling trays or pots in plastic and place in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks. Then grow in a bright, cool place at 12°-18°C (55°-65°F).","Thin or transplant seedlings to 30cm (12″) apart in richly fertile soil. Ammi prefers cool, moist soil. Water regularly until plants are established, and then only during hot, dry weather.",
Black Eyed Susan,Flower,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost, or direct sow about 2 weeks before last frost. If starting indoors, provide bright light and maintain a soil temperature of 21-25°C (70-75°F). Expect germination in 5-21 days.","Sow seeds on the surface of the soil. Thin or transplant to stand 30cm (12″) apart. In hot summers, some afternoon shade is appreciated.","Top dress with a thin layer of well rotted manure once a year. Keep watered in hot weather, and deadhead regularly. Plants may self-sow, which should be encouraged.",
Calendula,Flower,"Direct sow in early spring when light frost is still a possibility, and continue to sow every two to three weeks until early summer for fall flowers. Calendula is easiest from direct sowing, but can also be started indoors late winter for transplanting once daytime temperatures are steadily above 10°C (50°F). If starting indoors, maintain darkness and a soil temperature of 21°C (70°F) until germination occurs in 6-14 days, and then supply bright light to keep seedlings compact. Or direct sow in early autumn in Zones 8-10.","Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, and aim for a spacing of 15-45cm (6-18″) between plants.","Ideal pH: 5.5-7.0.Calendula grows easily in any regular garden soil. Pinch back young plants to encourage bushy growth. Occasional feeding is rewarded, but unnecessary. Keep plants watered, but try to avoid overhead watering as plants are susceptible to mildew. Deadhead regularly to prevent self-sowing.",
California Poppy,Flower,"Direct sow outdoors in spring after the local last frost date. Otherwise direct sow in autumn. It can be started indoors, but does not like being transplanted.","Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, spaced 20-25cm (8-10″) apart. Seeds should sprout in 14-21 days.","Grow in any average, well-drained soil. Deadhead regularly to prevent self sowing. California poppies are very likely to self sow when conditions are favourable.",
China Aster,Flower,,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before planting out, in peat pots or similar. Otherwise direct sow outdoors after the last frost date. Just cover the seeds. If starting indoors, provide bright light and a soil temperature of 18-21°C (65-70°","Space or transplant 30-45cm (12-18″) apart. This spacing is key to success later  in the season, so please follow the guidance. Do not pinch back young plants. Water regularly during dry spells. This plant is particularly sensitive to over-watering, and will not thrive if over-crowded, poorly ventilated, or situated close to a heat-reflecting surface. Mulch around the plants in summer to help keep the roots cool.",
Clelosia,Flower,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost, in peat or coir pots – Celosia does not like its roots disturbed by transplanting. Transplant at least two weeks after last frost, once nighttime temperatures are consistently above 10°C (50°F). Or direct sow outdoors after last frost. Seeds will germinate in 6-14 days.","Just cover the small seeds. If starting indoors, try to maintain a soil temperature of 21-25°C (70-75°F). Be sure to use peat pots, coir pots, or Cowpots, and transplant the whole pot into the soil at transplant time. This will minimize transplant shock.","Ideal pH: 6.0 -7.0. Plant in full sun or partial shade in ordinary, moist soil with a pH range of 6.0 to7.0. Celosia prefers warm temperatures.",
Cleome,Flower,"Start indoors from 6-8 weeks prior to the last frost date for transplanting (or simply direct sow) 3-4 weeks after last frost. If direct sowing, consider repeating every two weeks into early summer for a longer bloom period. Seeds will sprout in 10-14 days.","Sow on the surface of the soil. If starting indoors, seeds benefit from vernalization: Place seeds on the surface of moistened, sterilized seed starting mix in pots, and place pots in zip-top plastic bags inside the refrigerator for 2 weeks. Then move pots to bottom heat and maintain soil temperature at 21-25°C (70-75°F) until germination. Provide bright light.","Cleome is quite an undemanding annual. The stems are usually very strong and upright, but might benefit from support in very windy, exposed gardens.",
Columbine,Flower,"Direct sow in autumn or mid-winter. Seeds can be started indoors, but it’s more complicated: Sow seeds in flats of moistened, sterilized seed starting mix, and place these inside plastic bags in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks. Then sink the flats outdoors in the ground in a shady spot, and cover with glass. As seedlings appear, transplant them or pot them on. Germination takes 30-90 days.",Sow on the soil surface and transplant or thin seedlings to 30-50cm (12-20″) apart.,"Seedlings are easy to move, but delicate. Keep them out of strong sunlight, and water frequently, but gently. Deadhead regularly to prolong the blooming period. Columbine’s flowers are followed by distinctive seed pods that open on their own when the seeds are ripe. These can be removed to prevent self sowing, or for very easy harvest of the seeds. We like to harvest Columbine seeds mid-summer and spread them in any shady spot that could use some colour. Grow Columbine in humus-rich, moist, but well-drained soil.",
Coreopsis,Flower,"Start indoors in late winter for transplanting out after last frost. Or direct sow when a slight risk of frost is still possible. In areas where winter is mild, seeds can be direct sown in the fall, as well. Seeds germinate in 5-25 days. If starting indoors, maintain soil temperature at 12-21°C (55-70°F) and provide bright light.",Sow seeds on the surface of the soil. Transplant or thin to 15cm (6″).,"Deadhead often and do not feed, as fertilizers can reduce flowering. Coreopsis will adapt to many different soils, but prefers well drained, rich soil. This perennial species may self sow and also spread (very slowly) by underground rhizomes.",
Cornflower,Flower,"Direct sow starting just before last frost, and again every two weeks until end of spring. Centaurea can be direct sown in autumn as well. Starting indoors is not necessary, but can be accomplished by keeping seed trays in the dark at the optimal soil temperature of 15-21°C (60-70°F). Move under bright lights once germination occurs, and transplant out in late spring, after all risk of frost has passed.",Just cover the small seeds. Thin or space to 15-30cm (6-12″) apart.,"We acknowledge that sometimes appears on lists of invasive species. In our experience, for the back yard or balcony gardener, this is not an issue, and the plants are easily controlled. They are short rooted, and can be pulled up with little effort. Unlike some plants, its seeds simply drop locally if allowed to mature, and do not eject, and they do not spread by underground rhizome. We respectfully ask that gardeners who live in threatened or sensitive ecosystems take this into consideration when planting Centaurea, just like any other type of seed.",
Cosmos,Flower,"Direct sow after the last frost date. Several sowings will result in a very long bloom period. Cosmos can also be started indoors in late winter for transplanting after last frost, once daytime temperatures are above 10°C (50°F). Seeds will sprout in 3-10 days. Optimal temperature for germination: 21-25°C (70-75°F).",Sow seeds very shallowly only a few millimetres (1/8″) deep. Thin or transplant to 20-25cm (8-10″) apart.,"Most varieties can get quite tall, and in exposed or windy gardens can benefit from staking or trellis netting laid horizontally over the bed for the stems to grow through before blooming. Deadhead and cut for bouquets regularly to extend the bloom period.",
Daisy,Flower,"Indoors, sow around 8-10 weeks before planting out. Outdoors: In Zones 3-7, direct sow midsummer to early autumn for flowers the following year. In Zones 8-9 either direct sow in early spring when the soil is still cool and slight frost is still possible, or plant in autumn.",Sow on the surface of the soil. The seeds require light and a temperature of around 21°C (70°F). Expect germination in 10-25 days.,"Feed early in the season, and provide ample water. Deadhead (remove spent flowers) regularly to prevent self-sowing. In hot summers, cut back after flowering.",
Delphinium,Flower,"Sow indoors 8-10 weeks before planting out. Or simply direct sow in early spring, when a light frost is still possible, or early autumn. Seeds take 14-28 days to sprout.","Just cover the tiny seeds. If starting indoors, vernalize seeds by planting them in trays in sterilized seed starting mix. Place these inside plastic bags and refrigerate for 2 weeks. Then place them in total darkness and maintain a soil temperature of 10-12°C (50-55°) until sprouted. Once sprouts appear, place below bright light. Space or thin to 30-45cm (12-18″) between plants.","Deep, rich, well-drained, slightly acidic soil. For the most bloom potential, water well throughout the season, and feed once in the early spring. Remove spent flowers immediately after the first bloom, and feed again. When new growth reaches about 20cm (8″) tall, cut back old growth completely.",
Echinacea,Flower,"Sow indoors 8-10 weeks before planting out. If started indoors in late winter, Echinacea may bloom in the first year. It can also be direct sown in early spring or early fall. Germination should occur in 10-21 days.","Sow seeds shallowly at only 3mm (1/8″) deep. If starting indoors, provide total darkness and a soil temperature of 21-25°C (70-75°F). Once sprouts appear, provide bright light.","Space plants at 30-38cm (12-15″) apart in any average, well drained, slightly acidic soil. Water plants regularly for best results, keeping the leaves as dry as possible. Leave seed heads intact over winter to feed birds and provide shelter for beneficial insects.",
Eryngium,Flower,"Germination can be slow, and the seeds benefit from vernalization. Sow pre-moistened flats and seal them in plastic bags in late winter. Refrigerate for two to three weeks. Then move the flats outdoors to a shady location after all threat of frost has passed. Transplant as seedlings appear, which usually takes two to three weeks. Or, more simply, direct sow in the fall.","Sow seeds 2mm (1/8″) deep. Germination can take 5 to 90 days, so be patient.",Water only during very dry spells. Carefully mulch around the crowns with fine gravel to keep plants dry over winter. The long taproots make transplanting difficult.,
Forget-Me-Nots,Flower,"Direct sow in early spring when a light frost is still possible. Otherwise start indoors 6-8 weeks before planting out. Direct sow again in autumn. Seeds will sprout in 5-10 days, particularly if maintained at their optimal soil temperature of 18-24°C (65-75°F).","Sow seeds shallowly at 5mm (¼”) deep, and thin or space to 20-30cm (8-12″) apart. If starting indoors, keep seeds in total darkness until they sprout, and then provide bright light.","Ordinary, well-drained garden soil with a neutral to slightly acid pH range will work well. Weak plants result from rich soil. This species is well suited to xeriscaping. Deadhead to avoid self sowing.",
Foxglove,Flower,"Direct sow outdoors after last frost for flowers the following year. In mild winter areas, direct sow in autumn as well. For flowers the first year, sow indoors very early, in December or January for transplanting 2-3 weeks before last frost. Seeds take 14-21 days to germinate. If starting indoors, provide bright light and a soil temperature of 15-18°C (60-65°F).",Sow on the surface. Space or transplant 45-60cm (18-24″) apart.,"Water plants deeply on a regular basis. Cut off finished flowering stems to prevent self-sowing. Otherwise, expect foxgloves to naturalize around your garden. Foxgloves will languish in periods of heat and drought, so provide extra moisture during those times. If allowed to go to seed, foxgloves tend to self sow for several generations.",
Gilia,Flower,"Gilia is most successful if direct sown outdoors 2-3 weeks before last frost, or in the autumn in mild climates. Alternately, start indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost, and harden seedlings off gradually in a cold frame before transplanting. This is one of those annuals that requires almost no effort: Sprinkle seeds where they are to grow, and most gardeners will have a very high success rate.",Sow seeds 2mm (1/8″) deep.

Stake these tall growing plants in windy gardens. Ordinary, well-drained soil will do, but Helenium prefers rich soil. Don’t let the soil dry out completely during the growing season, and deadhead regularly once flowering begins. Divide clumps every three to four years to maintain vigour. Division works best in the spring north of Zone 7, and in the fall in southern climes.",
Iberis,Flower,"Start indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date. Or direct sow outdoors after the last frost date, every two weeks into July for a continuous bloom period. Seeds should germinate in 10-20 days. Ideal soil temperature for germination: 21-30°C (70-85°F).","If starting indoors, use peat or coir pots and bottom heat. Only cover seed by a couple of millimetres (1/8″) of soil. Transplant out after last frost at 15-30cm (6-12″) apart.",Ideal pH: 6.0-7.0. Iberis does not respond well to transplanting or being moved. Direct sowing is probably simplest. Choose any well-drained garden soil with a neutral pH. Trim plants lightly after flowering to encourage a second bloom. Iberis may self sow.,
Lobiela,Flower,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before planting out, and do not plant out until nighttime temperatures are reliably 10°C (50°F) or warmer. On the coast this means sowing indoors around in early April, and planting out in late May. Starting indoors is highly recommended.","Sow on the surface of sterilized seed starting mix. Do not cover the dust-like seeds. Do what you can to sow them evenly on the soil. Provide bright light and a soil temperature of 18-25°C (65-75°F). Germination takes 15-21 days. Water with a mist sprayer. Consider starting Lobelia in 12- or 24-cell plug inserts. It is nice to be able to pull apart clumps of Lobelia for later transplanting. Smaller cell inserts work alright too, but the seedlings tend to grow together in mats, so pulling them apart will cause some loss.",,
Marigold,Flower,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost, or direct sow 2 weeks before last frost.

In our experience,  returns with vigour in the second year and begins blooming by June here on the west coast.",Barely cover the small seeds using sterilized seed starting mix. Space transplants 30-60cm (12-24″) apart.,"For many years several Asclepias species were listed as invasive weeds because of their sometimes aggressive spreading by underground rhizomes and their giant, dandelion-like seeds. The seeds emerge from very conspicuous pods which are easily removed before they dry and crack. As the population of wild Asclepias diminished, so did the populations of many butterflies that depend on them as food and nursery plants (including the endangered Monarch). Now that they have been de-listed, we encourage home gardeners to grow them with the advance knowledge that they can spread. Try growing them in a large container like a half barrel, and be conscious of the seed pods as they develop. In short, please be responsible with Asclepias species.",

Ratibida,Flower,"Start transplants in a cold frame in early spring, or direct sow in May to June. Starting indoors requires vernalization – wrap planted pots in plastic and store in the refrigerator for one week, and then provide 20°-24°C (68°-75°F). Do this step 4-6 weeks before planting out. Seeds will germinate in 7-42 days.",Barely cover the seeds with soil. Transplant or thin to stand 30-60cm (12-24″) apart.,"Stake tall growing plants in windy gardens. Ordinary, well-drained soil will do. Ratibida is susceptible to foliar diseases like powdery and downy mildew, fungal spots, and leaf smut. To avoid these, mulch around the plants and only water in the morning, avoiding getting the leaves wet. These plants are highly resistant to heat and humidity, and they are suitable for xeriscaping.",
Scabiosa,Flower,"Sow indoors 8 – 10 weeks before planting out. Sow outdoors in early spring, when a risk of light frost is still possible. In mild winter areas, seeds can be sown in the fall.",Barely cover the small seeds. Space plants 30-45cm (8-12″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 7.0-8.0.Deadhead regularly. Grow in average, humus-rich well drained soil.",
Sisyrinchium,Flower,"Germination can be slow, and the seeds benefit from vernalization. Sow pre-moistened flats and seal them in plastic bags. Refrigerate for two to three weeks. Then move the flats outdoors to a shady location after all threat of frost has passed. Transplant as seedlings appear.","Sow seeds 2mm (1/8″) deep. Germination can take 30 to 180 days, so be patient.","Ideal pH: 6.5 – 7.8.Transplant after last frost into average, well drained soil. Sisyrinchium grows well in most situations, but it excels in moist, well-drained, fertile soil.",
Snapdragon,Flower,"Start snapdragons indoors, 8-10 weeks before planting out. Transplant out after last frost. Direct sowing is less reliable. Provide bright light and a soil temperature of 12°C (55°F). Seeds should sprout in 10-21 days.","Sow on the surface of a sterilized seed starting mix. To avoid damping off (to which snapdragons are somewhat prone), increase ventilation, use a layer of vermiculite on top of the soil, and water only from below. Transplant out once daytime temperatures are consistently above 10°C (50°F) and space 30cm (12″) apart.","Grow these easy sub-shrubs in rich, soil with a neutral pH. Pinch back young plants once 6 leaves have appeared for bushier mature plants. Feed lightly twice, before any flowers appear. Deadhead often. If flowering seems to subside, cut back dramatically, and then feed and water generously.",
Soapwort,Flower,"Start indoors in peat or coir pots 8-10 weeks before planting out. Alternately, direct sow in early spring or early autumn. For best results, place the seeds on the surface of pre-moistened soil, and tuck inside a plastic bag. Refrigerate for three weeks, and then provide bright light and a soil temperature of 21°C (70°F). Germination should occur in 10-21 days.",,"Transplant into dry, rocky soil in full sun or partial shade at 10-20cm (4-8”) apart. Water only during very dry spells, and do not fertilize. Cut back after blooming to keep plants compact. Saponaria plants do not transplant well, and they dislike wet soil over winter.",
Sunflower,Flower,"Direct sow repeatedly after the last frost date. Starting indoors is possible, but does not gain much time. If sunflowers are allowed to get root-bound, they will lack stability at transplant time, and will require staking. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 21-30°C (70-85°F). Seeds should sprout in 10-14 days.","Sow seeds 5mm-1cm  (¼-½”) deep. Space dwarf varieties 15cm (6″) apart, but give the giants lots of room at 1m (3′) between plants.","To grow really big plants with really big flowers, enrich the soil with organic matter and incorporate 2 cups of balanced organic fertilizer per 3m (10′) of row, and irrigate regularly. When the plants are 30cm (12) tall, dissolve 5ml (1 tsp) of borax (for boron) in 350 ml (12 fl oz) of water and spread the solution over 5m (15′) of row. Be careful not to over-apply this solution. This application of boron will produce bigger seeds and flower heads. Do not apply boron to other garden plants. When the back of the flower head turns yellow, it is ready to be cut from the plant.",
Sweet Pea,Flower,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before the last average frost date for your area. Or direct sow outdoors in early spring, while the soil is still cool and light frost is still possible. Plants are strongest from an early, indoor sowing. Sweet peas can also be direct sown in the fall where winters are mild.","Sow seeds 1cm (½”) deep. If starting indoors, chip seeds or soak them in warm water for 24 hours. Use a seed inoculant for the best results. Maintain a soil temperature of 12-18°C (55-65°F). Seeds should germinate in 10-20 days.","For best results, prepare the sweet pea bed the previous fall. Cultivate the soil to 45cm (18″) deep, incorporating a generous amount of finished compost. Also dig in bone meal. At transplant time, dig ¼ cup balanced organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each plant. Space vines at 15cm (6″) and provide trellis support. Mulch around plants to keep the soil as cool as possible, and water during dry weather. Keep plants picked to prolong the blooming period.",
Tobacco,Flower,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost, or direct sow outdoors any time after the risk of frost has passed. Transplant after last frost.","Sprinkle seeds on the surface of the soil, and keep moist until germination in 10-20 days.","Water during hot, dry spells. Deadhead regularly to maintain a neat appearance and encourage further blooming. Stake in windy, exposed gardens. Remove any growth that comes under attack by aphids, or dislodge them with a blast from the hose.",
Viola,Flower,"Start indoors 10-12 weeks before planting out. For spring planting after last frost, that means up to 3 months growing time indoors. Otherwise, sow direct outdoors in summer to early autumn. For winter-flowering pansies in Zones 7-9, start seeds in mid to late June. For Direct sow in autumn or early spring. This variety benefits from a long exposure to cool soil.","Even though the seeds are tiny, they need to be sown 5mm (¼”) deep. Keep the soil at 18-25°C (65-75°F), in complete darkness until they germinate in around 14 days. Then provide bright light to keep plants compact. Space at 15-23cm (6-9″) in the garden.  Barely cover the tiny seeds. Sow in flats sunk into the ground against a north-facing wall, and cover with glass or plastic. Remove cover when seedlings emerge. Germination can take up to 50 days, so be patient.","After germination, pansies and violas are easy. Fertilize once or twice in early growth and provide a mulch around plants to keep roots cool as weather warms. Deadhead to prevent self-sowing, particularly with Johnny-Jump-Ups. Transplant after last frost or in the autumn where winters are mild, spacing at 15-30cm (6-12”) apart. Grow in partial shade, or in full sun where summers are cool. This variety prefers rich, moist, well-drained soil with a pH of 5.5-7.0. Add well-rotted manure at transplant time.",
Wildflower,Flower,"Try to direct sow wildflower seeds during the period two weeks before, and eight weeks after, your last average frost date. Sowing when there is some risk of minor frost may improve germination. Wildflower seeds can also be sown in the autumn, but a certain percentage of seeds to may be lost to water, birds, and animals. To make the most of the annual species, direct sow in early spring."," If there are already no plants (including weeds) growing in the planting site, there may be a problem with the soil. Possible issues may be soil fertility, lack of drainage, or the need for soil amendments to improve texture. In such spots (eg, beneath a cedar tree), few plants will thrive, including wildflowers. Remove as much existing vegetation as possible through pulling or tilling under in order to minimize competition. Loosen the soil by scraping, raking, or tilling. Wildflower blends will not usually take if planted into existing lawn because the thatch prevents their contact with soil. In small areas, seeds can be scattered by hand. In larger areas, you may want to employ a lawn spreader or some other mechanical means. We recommend adding 1-2 parts clean, dry sand to 1 part wildflower seeds which will help the seeds spread evenly. Do not use beach sand, as it usually contains salt. It may be wise to spread most of the seed, but to save some for filling in bald spots at a later date. Seeds must come into contact with the soil in order to germinate. Do not bury seeds more than 2-3 times their thickness. Aim for a planting density of 70 seeds per square foot. 90g of seeds will cover 1,000 ft². Use 4kg per acre. 500g covers about 5,500 ft². If seeding an area where site preparation and weeding are not possible, double this rate.","Keep the seeded area as evenly moist as possible to help the seeds germinate and the young seedlings become established. Weeds need to be kept under control. Once they are growing, most mixes will not require additional water except in long periods of hot, dry weather. All of our mixes should re-grow for several years, but will eventually benefit from re-seeding. In late summer, many of the components will produce seed heads that can be harvested and replanted the following spring.",
Yarrow,Flower,"Sow indoors 8-10 weeks before planting out after the last frost date. Transplant or direct sow in early spring or early autumn. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 15-18°C (60-65°F). Seeds can take 10 to as long as 100 days to sprout, so be patient. Bottom heat speeds germination.","Sow on the surface of the soil, under bright lights if starting indoors. Transplants can go out while the soil is still cool and there is still some risk of light frost. Space transplants at 30-60cm (12-24″) apart.","Ideal pH: 5.5 to 7.0.Yarrow is a tough plant that is suitable for , and it will adapt to pretty much any soil. For best results, grow in a loamy, well drained soil. Divide plants every 3-4 years. Cut plants to ground level in autumn.",
Zinnia,Fower,"Direct sow after last frost. Zinnias don’t transplant well, but can be started indoors, if necessary, in peat or coir pots, 6-8 weeks before planting out. Maintain a soil temperature of 21-26°C (70-80°F). Seeds should germinate in 5-24 days.","Just cover Zinnia seeds, and aim for a final spacing of 25-30cm (10-12″) between plants.","Depending on the variety, it takes about two months after sowing for the first flowers to appear. Take regular cuttings of Zinnia stems to enjoy indoors, starting mid-summer right into the fall. Cutting encourages the production of new flowers and seems to stimulate the plants for greater vigour. Watch for signs of powdery mildew on the leaves, usually in late summer. Try to avoid overhead watering to prevent mildew.",
Gaillardia,Fruit,"Direct sowing is easiest, and is done after last frost, or in the autumn in places where winter is mild. They can also be sown indoors 4-6 weeks before last frost. These would be transplanted out once daytime temperatures are consistently above 10°C (50°F). Seeds will germinate in 7-20 days. If starting indoors, provide bright light and a soil temperature of 21°C (70°F).",Sow on the surface of the soil. Transplant or thin to stand 15-30cm (6-12″) apart.,"Feed once, just as flowering begins, and top-dress with well-rotted manure once in summer. Deadhead regularly. Water regularly during dry spells, keeping leaves as dry as possible – this can be done in the early morning, so leaves dry off by noon. Gaillardia will self sow.",
Berry,Fruit,,,,
Goji Berry,Fruit,"Sow indoors about 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost. It’s important to cultivate strong seedlings, so once the seeds sprout, use generous artificial light.","Sow 2 to 3 seeds in each pot, about 5mm (¼”) deep. Use a sterilized seed starting mix, and do not add fertilizer. Keep soil moist until seeds germinate, and then place under bright lights. After the third true leaf emerges, transplant each seedling on to its own individual pot. Gentle hardening off of seedlings is essential in order to avoid transplant shock.","Ideal pH: 6.8 - 8.1.Goji is a shrubby plant that can, in time, grow 1-3m (3-10′) tall. Growers space Goji plants 60cm (24″) apart in rows that are 2m (6′) apart. Spaced this way, 15 plants in a 30 foot row can produce up to 100 lbs of berries in a year. Goji is self pollinating, so even a single plant will produce fruit.Goji is unusual in that it prefers relatively infertile, slightly alkaline soil. Goji reacts poorly to fertilizer and manure, so if growing in a large container, use simple top soil with some perlite mixed in for drainage. Avoid peat-based soils.If severe winter weather is expected, it is wise to mulch around the bases of Goji plants, or move container plants into a cool but frost free area such as a garage.",
Strawberry,Grass,"Sow indoors in the winter. An earlier start may result in berries the first year. Start any time between December and the beginning of February. After that time, they will still produce plants, but berries may not be produced during the first season. Transplant out at least 3 weeks after last frost. Strawberry seeds will germinate at any time of the year if some simple steps are taken.","Germination is the trickiest aspect to growing strawberries. Be patient, and try the tricks below.Tuck strawberry seed packet inside a sealed plastic bag or airtight container and place in the refrigerator freezer (not deep freeze) for 3-4 weeks. After removing the bag or container,  until it (and its living contents) have reached room temperature. This may take several hours. Err on the side of caution. Opening the package too quickly may result in water condensing on the cold seeds, and this will reduce your chances of success.Once the sealed package has “thawed” to room temperature, the seeds are ready to plant. Sow the seeds on the surface of pre-moistened, sterilized seed starting mix in trays or small containers. Place these on a piece of felt or other thick cloth that has its end sitting in water. The idea is to wick up water from below so that the seedling medium stays constantly and evenly damp until germination.An alternative method is to sow strawberry seeds on the surface of moistened soil in a germination tray (or in small pots). Tuck the tray or pots inside a sealed plastic bag, and store in the refrigerator for 3-4 weeks.Move the seeded trays under bright fluorescent lights at a constant temperature of 18-24°C (65-75°F).  work very well. Germination may take anywhere from 7 days to 6 weeks: Be patient. Once germination occurs, increase ventilation around the plants to prevent damping off.Once the seedlings develop their third true leaf, they can be gently transplanted into their own pots. Be sure to harden strawberry seedlings off carefully and gradually before transplanting outside.","Space transplants 60cm (24″) apart in rows 90-120cm (36-48″) apart. Ever-bearing varieties (such as ours) tend to produce fewer runners, and may produce more fruit if the runners are removed. In the first year of growth, it may be preferable to encourage runners, and let them fill in the spaces between transplants with new offspring plants.Grow strawberries in a well-drained, sandy loam that has been generously dug with organic matter such as finished compost or well-rotted manure. Dig ¼ cup complete organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant. Keep soil moist, but not soggy. A mulch of straw around plants may help prevent the soil from drying out.",
Fescue,Herb,Sow in the spring or fall (fall is recommended) at a depth of 5-10mm (¼-½”). ,"Use Tall Fescue to overseed existing lawn at a rate of 1.8kg (4 lbs) per thousand square feet. Better yet, seed a new area, with no turf present, at 3.6kg (8 lbs) of seed per thousand square feet.",,
Basil,Herb,"Basil grows well in containers indoors at any time of year provided you can supply enough light. For outdoor growing, sow basil seeds throughout late spring for transplanting to the garden after the summer solstice. Or direct sow in early summer, once the soil has warmed up. Basil requires warm soil and full sun. Optimal temperature for germination: 21°C (70°F). Seeds should sprout in 5-10 days.","Sow seeds 1cm (½”) deep in sterilized seed starting mix. Basil is prone to damping off, so once seeds sprout, make sure they are adequately ventilated, and kept under very bright light. Thin to 20-25cm (8-10″) apart. Using bottom heat speeds germination.","Use any rich, loose, well drained soil. Once plants are 15cm (6″) tall, pinch out the growing tips to encourage really bushy growth prior to harvest. Watch for signs of flower buds forming in mid-summer, and pinch these off to promote more foliage. GerminationUsual seed life: 3 years.","Frequent harvesting will prolong the life of the plant. Basil leaves have the best flavour just before the plant flowers, and if you plan to preserve some of your basil or make a big batch of pesto, this is the best time to harvest. Flowering can be delayed by pinching or clipping off new flower buds.Tear basil rather than chop with a knife because chopping tends to bruise the leaves. Add basil to food just before serving so as to get the full aroma and effect. Cooking for any length tends to make the minty side of basil come to the forefront.Basil is best fresh, but can be preserved by drying or by freezing. To freeze, tear the leaves into small pieces and freeze small batches of them, with water, in ice cube trays. Once frozen, the cubes can be saved in zip-lock type bags and labeled for later use. This will preserve the fresh flavour of basil for up to four months."
Bergamot,Herb,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost, or direct sow in early spring when a light frost is still possible. Seeds can also be direct sown in the fall, as the first frost approaches. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 15-21°C (60-70°F). Seeds should sprout in 10-40 days. Bottom heat will speed germination.","Barely cover the tiny seeds with soil. Thin or space transplants 45-60cm (18-24″) apart. These vigorous perennials will grow in, closer together over time.","Any ordinary garden soil will work. Plant in full sun to partial shade. Where summers are long, plants are prone to mildew, so avoid overhead watering. Deadhead regularly to prolong the blooming period. These perennial plants spread by rhizome growth, and should be dug and divided every three years.","Pick the leaves as desired for fresh use in the kitchen. For drying, harvest leaves before the flowers open. Cut flowers for drying as soon as they’re fully open. Masses of tiered pink-purple blossoms grow from August until frost."
Borage,Herb,"Direct sow in mid- to late spring. Borage develops a delicate taproot, so it’s best direct sown where it is to grow. Borage does not transplant well. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 21°C (70°F). Seeds should sprout in 5-15 days.","Sow seeds 1cm (½”) deep, and thin to 60cm (24″) apart. Borage will get large and fill in spaces between plants.","Borage is an un-fussy, self-sowing annual. To avoid self-sowing, the flower heads need to be picked regularly. Borage does best in full sun in well drained soil. GerminationUsual seed life: 3 years.",Pick fresh flowers for freezing or drying for bouquets. Cut the fresh leaves during the summer to add to salads or spreads.
Catnip,Herb,"Sow seeds indoors in late winter, and transplant or direct sow in 2-6 weeks after the last frost date. Catnip can also be direct sown in the fall where it is to grow. Bottom heat will speed germination. Ideal temperature for germination: 21-27°C (70-80°F). Seeds should sprout in 10-20 days.",Sow on the soil surface or barely covered with perlite. Thin plants or transplant to 30cm (12″) apart. Keep seedlings well protected from cats.,"Catnip does very well in containers, raised beds, or borders in full sun to partial shade. The main challenge to growing it is protecting it from cats. After the main bloom, plants should be cut back hard to encourage a second bloom and tidy shape. GerminationUsual seed life: 5 years.","To save the summer catmint bounty, harvest when fully grown, and keep the plant picked regularly."
Chervil,Herb,"Start seeds indoors or direct sow in spring. Direct sow in summer and protect plants from midday sun for a winter crop – chervil is quite hardy. Keep transplanting to a minimum, as chervil develops a delicate taproot that does not respond well to disturbance.","Sow seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep, and space plants 23-30cm (9-12″) apart.","Chervil plants will be ready for cutting 6-8 weeks after sowing. It’s probably best to grow chervil in relatively damp soil in partial shade, as plants will bolt in hot mid-summer weather. Transplanting may also trigger bolting. Cover with a cloche in winter, and it will just keep growing until it blooms the following spring.","Begin harvesting as needed 6-8 weeks after sowing, or when plants are 10cm (4″) tall. Drying kills nearly all the flavour of chervil leaves, so freezing is best for long term storage."
Chives,Herb,"Start indoors from late winter through mid-spring, and transplant or direct sow once the soil has warmed in late spring. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 19°C (65°F).","Sow 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep and keep moist until germination. If starting indoors, use bottom heat and plant 10-15 seeds per cell in a 72 cell plug tray. Transplant either into containers or into the garden once the soil has warmed up. Space clumps 15cm (6″) apart.","Clumps of chives spread to about 30cm (12″) across. They should be divided at that point and replanted to stand 30cm (12″) apart or broken up for container planting. Remove flower stems before they open to increase foliage production. Keep chives watered evenly throughout the season. For a winter crop, try digging up a small clump after the foliage dies back in the fall. Plant this in a container using loamy potting mix, and bring indoors to a warm, and very bright windowsill.","The whole plant can be cut down to 4cm (2″) from the ground. Use scissors and take as much as needed. Chives don’t dehydrate well, so use fresh portions regularly. The flowers can be used in salads or to flavour vinegars."
Cilantro,Herb,Direct sow from just after the last frost date to late spring. Direct sow in the fall under cover for a winter crop. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 15°C (60°F). Seeds should sprout in 5-10 days.,"Sow 2cm (1″) deep in short rows. Thin seedlings to stand 5-10cm (2-4″) apart if harvesting leaves. If growing for seed, allow 23cm (9″) between plants.","Cilantro is tricky because several factors can cause it to bolt. Avoid transplanting for this reason, and avoid hot conditions as well as too much moisture. It does best in light, well-drained soil in partial shade, in relatively dry conditions. This is easy to achieve beneath a cloche in winter, where cilantro will thrive. Once it blooms, the seeds ripen suddenly, in only a couple of days, so care should be taken to prevent self sowing or simply losing those useful seeds. GerminationUsual seed life: 3 years.","Pick young leaves once they have reached about 10cm (4″) in height. The flavour, though intense when fresh, diminishes quickly when dried or cooked, so always add cilantro just before serving. Try freezing it in ice cube trays with water. The stems and roots are also full of flavour. Harvest the seeds by sticking 6 or 8 seed heads in a paper bag and hanging it up somewhere airy, away from direct sunlight. The bag will catch the seeds as they ripen and fall out."
Culantro,Herb,"Start the seeds in CowPots or medium sized coir pots. Culantro is a biennial plant with a central taproot, so it does not transplant well. The strategy is to transplant its whole root system as needed. Start seeds indoors about eight weeks before the last frost date. That’s early February on the west coast. This tropical herb requires warm soil. Optimal temperature for germination: 26°C (80°F). Seeds should sprout in 14-28 days.","Sow the tiny seeds on the surface of pre-moistened, sterilized seed starting mix. Using bottom heat speeds germination. Do not transplant until night time temperatures are consistently 10°C (50°F) or higher. Keep the planting medium quite moist. Aim for an ultimate spacing of one plant per one gallon pot, or three plants per five gallon pot.","Rich, moist, well-drained soil in a warm location is best. Culantro thrives in full sun, but there seems to be some consensus among growers that it will be more productive over a longer period if grown in partial shade. The leaves grow larger and more tender this way. GerminationUsual seed life: 2 years. Using fresh seed each year is recommended.","Typically culantro is used as a fresh herb, cutting individual leaves from the plant (or row) as needed. If frost is expected or plants appear to be bolting, harvest at once, and allow the leaves to dry completely with the tap root attached. The leaves retain their flavour surprisingly well. It can also be chopped and frozen in water in ice cube trays like basil, but this seems to diminish the flavour a little."
Cumin,Herb,"Cumin needs a long hot season to produce seeds. Start indoors four weeks before the last frost date, and transplant outside once temperatures are steadily above 15°C (60°F). Ideal temperature for germination: 20-30°C (68-86°F), so use bottom heat. Seeds should sprout in 7-14 days.",Sow 5mm (¼”) deep. Transplant at a spacing of 10cm (4″).,"Cumin needs approximately 120 days to maturity from the sowing date to produce viable seeds. It is an annual member of the carrot family, and produces umbelliferous flowers that are highly attractive to beneficial garden insect predators. Flowering begins mid-summer. GerminationUsual seed life: 2 years.","Cut the seed heads to dry indoors as late in the season as possible, or as soon as seeds can be seen to fall from the seed head."
Dill,Herb,"Direct sow late spring through summer, or sow when cucumbers are transplanted, to coincide maturity for pickling. Dill tends to bolt if transplanted, so it is best direct sown. Stagger the harvest by sowing every 2-3 weeks for a constant supply of fresh leaves. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 15-21°C (60-70°F). Seeds should germinate in 10-21 days.",Dill seeds need some light to germinate. Sow seeds no more than 5mm (¼”) deep in rows 45cm (18″) apart. Thin the plants to stand at least 15cm (6″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 5.0-7.0. Grow in moderately rich soil in full sun. Water and feed regularly, and stop any overhead watering once plants are 60cm (24″) tall to prevent issues with mildew forming on the leaves. GerminationUsual seed life: 3 years.","Begin harvesting the tasty leaves once plants reach 15cm (6″) tall. About 12 weeks after sprouting the seed heads begin to form. When the first seeds have turned brown, cut the whole head and hang it upside down for the drying seeds to fall out into trays or paper bags. Dill leaf loses most of its flavour when dried, so freeze it in ice cube trays filled with water for use all winter."
Lavender,Herb,"Lavender germinates most evenly if seeds can be collected in the autumn and sown on the surface of a seed tray with bottom heat maintaining 4-10°C (40-50°F). The seedlings are then overwintered in a cool greenhouse or cold frame with good ventilation. Seedlings can then be potted on as needed.Another method is to start the seeds indoors in winter, planting a few seeds in a few pots with sterilized seed starting mix. Dampen the mix, press the seeds into the surface, insert the pots into plastic bags, and put them in the freezer for about a week. Let them come to room temperature on their own, and then use bottom heat as indicated above.","Avoid using a plastic lid or covering, as this will keep the soil more moist than needed. Barely cover the seed, as they germinates in 14-21 days in warm soil. Do not use a plastic lid or covering because this will make the surface of the soil too moist. If watering is necessary, water from below. If germination is low after 3-4 weeks, lower the temperature to 5-10°C (40-50°F) for 2 weeks, then raise it again. Pot up the tiny seedlings and grow them on in a protected greenhouse or windowsill to set into the garden in the spring.","Lavender prefers full sun and well drained, fertile soil. Trim plants back hard in spring, just as new growth starts – but never prune back into the woody part of the stems. This will give a rush of even growth for the first leaves and bloom. Cut back again in early autumn, but again – never into old wood.","Gather the flowers just as they open. Dry on open trays, or by hanging in small bunches. Pick the leaves anytime to use fresh, or if dehydrating lavender leaves, gather before flowering starts."
Lemon Balm,Herb,"Start indoors 6 to 8 weeks before last frost, and transplant out or direct sow once day time temperatures are steadily above 10°C (50°F).","Barely cover the tiny seeds. Use a sterilized potting soil, and keep watering to an absolute minimum – just enough to keep the medium from drying out. Germination takes 10-14 days. Transplant at a spacing of 45cm (18″) into the garden.","Choose a shady spot or a location where plants can be protected from midday sun. Lemon balm prefers a fertile, moist soil in a cooler part of the garden. Plants grown in partial shade will be larger and more succulent than those exposed to full sun.",Pick leaves throughout the summer for fresh use. The aroma is rapidly lost when dried or stored.
Lovage,Herb,"Start indoors in spring or direct sow in the fall. If starting indoors, try to maintain a soil temperature of 15°C (60°F). Once seedlings are big enough to handle, harden them off before transplanting to the garden.","Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, three or four seeds per pot, and thin to the strongest seedling. Germination takes 10-14 days. Keep soil moist until they are established, and transplant out at least 60cm (24″) apart.","Choose the site for your lovage with care, as they are long lived perennials, and they grow tall. They will tolerate partial shade to full sun. Lovage develops a long taproot, so cultivate the bed deeply, and add well rotted manure. Consider grouping lovage together with other perennial food plants like asparagus and rhubarb in a permanent bed. Allow for a spread of at least 1m (3′).","The leaves of lovage can part a wonderful meaty flavour to vegetable soups, stews and stocks. After the herb has flowered, the leaves develop a bitter taste, so it is best harvested in early summer. The fresh leaves can be frozen in ice cubes for winter use. Chop the leaves finely and distribute them in ice cube trays, then cover with water. When the cubes are frozen, put them in zip-top bags."
Mint,Herb,"Sow indoors 8-10 weeks before last frost, or direct sow in late spring. Seeds should sprout in 10-16 days. Bottom heat will speed germination.",Sow seeds no more than 5mm (¼”) deep in moist soil. Space plants 45-60cm (18-24″) apart.,"Mint spreads in the garden with gusto via a vigorous root system, so it may be preferable to confine it to planters on the balcony or in a raised bed. Prune plants back hard in early summer to promote good top growth. Bring some inside to grow in a small container over winter to grow on a brightly lit windowsill.","Clip leaves or branches as needed throughout the year. Mint is so hardy and tough that it will grow right back. Dry the leaves and flowers for peppermint tea, or use them fresh. The flowers are edible and bring distinctive character to salads and sweets."
Oregano,Herb,Start indoors in plug trays from late winter to mid-spring. Starting indoors is more reliable than direct sowing. Use bottom heat to achieve a constant soil temperature of 15°C (60°F) for best results. Germination occurs in 7 to 14 days.,"Oregano seeds are dust-like, so handle them with care. Prepare containers or plug trays using sterilized seed starting mix, and water the soil. Then try to evenly distribute the tiny seeds on the surface of the soil. Do not bury them. Using bottom heat will improve the overall success rate. As seedlings grow, keep soil on the dry side. Pot on as necessary or transplant to the garden in late spring to early summer.","Grow in a sunny and warm spot. Aim for 25cm (10″) between plants. Cut plants back after flowering to prevent them from getting straggly. As autumn approaches, divide some to bring inside over winter. Cut back the year’s growth to about 6cm (2½”) from the soil.",Pick the leaves throughout the season as needed. Oregano leaves can be dried or frozen. Store dried leaves or whole stalks in air tight containers away from bright light.
Parsley,Herb,,"If starting indoors, sow seeds 1cm (½”) deep, in sterilized seed starting mix, in peat pots or plug trays. Like its cousins dill and cilantro, parsley develops a taproot that does better if left undisturbed. Sow outdoors in drills 3cm (1¼”) deep, spaced 8cm (3″) apart. Thin final plants to 15cm (6″) apart.","Grow parsley in a deeply dug bed. Add a generous amount of rotted manure or finished compost to the bed several weeks in advance, or the previous fall. For summer crops, aim to grow plants in a place where they will receive some shade during the day – either on the east or west side of a structure or fence works well. For winter crops, start new seeds in late summer and transplant out to a warm, sunny location by September. Parsley will grow all winter (in mild areas) if cloche protection is provided.","Cut individual sprigs from the outside of the plant or the whole plant as needed. Sprigs can be dried in the food dehydrator. Chop sprigs into the portions that your favourite recipes call for, place into an ice cube tray and add water to cover. When frozen, bag and store until needed. This keeps the parsley fresh for months."
Rosemary,Herb,"Sow indoors from late winter to early spring. Transplant or direct sow starting in late spring, once soil has warmed. Starting indoors is more reliable. Use bottom heat to maintain an optimal soil temperature of 27-32°C (80-90°F).","Most nurseries grow rosemary from cuttings, not seeds. Germination is notoriously low, so plant more seeds than needed. Sow them barely covered with sterilized seed starting mix over bottom heat. Once germinated, rosemary is highly prone to damping off, so keep watering to a minimum, provide bright light, and ventilation. Keep each plant in its own pot for the first winter and offer them protection from severe cold. Transplant to the garden the following spring at a spacing of 60-90cm (24-36″).","If growing rosemary in containers, provide monthly feedings of liquid fertilizer. Keep watered in hot weather. Mulch around all rosemary plants as cold weather approaches. If their roots freeze in times of hard frost, the plants will die.","Harvest individual leaves by pulling them off the plant. Harvest branches or stems for drying by cutting with a clean, very sharp knife. Scissors may crush the plant’s tissues at the cut end."
Sage,Herb,"Start indoors mid-winter to mid-spring. Transplant out or direct sow starting late spring. Starting indoors may be more reliable, particularly if using bottom heat and maintaining optimal soil temperature at 15-21°C (60-70°F). Seeds should sprout in 2 to 3 weeks.","Sow seeds 3mm (1/8″) deep, and keep soil just moist, not wet. Thin or transplant to 45-60cm (18-24″) apart.","In spring, trim established plants back by a third to encourage new growth. Once the flowers have finished in June/early July, trim the plants back again. A second bloom sometimes follows, and this pruning will keep plants bushy and compact. After a few years, sage bushes can become quite large. Keep in check by pruning.",
Savory,Herb,Sow the very tiny seeds indoors about 4-6 weeks before the last frost. They should sprout in 10-15 days.,"Sow seeds on the surface of prepared starting mix. Do not bury them as they need light to germinate. Don’t bother using bottom heat, as the seeds will sprout well without it. When seedlings are large enough to handle, delicately pot them on or transplant out to the herb garden once all risk of frost is past. Both varieties benefit from careful hardening off to reduce transplant shock.",,
Shiso,Herb,"Start indoors in early spring, a couple of weeks after the last frost date, or direct sow outdoors in late spring, once night time temperatures are steadily above 8°C (45°F).","If starting indoors, use equal parts sterilized seed starting mix to perlite. Mix well and add to seed trays with domes. Use bottom heat from a  to maintain a soil temperature of 20°C (70°F). Seeds should germinate in 7 to 14 days. Be careful not to over-water, particularly once seeds have germinated, as the seedlings are prone to damping off. Remove the dome at germination, but maintain bottom heat until seedlings are large enough to pot on into larger containers.Alternatively, direct sow outdoors into well-drained garden soil. Seeds should germinate in 14 to 20 days.","Shiso does best in full sun to partial shade, in fertile, well-drained soil. Allow transplants to become established, and then grow as you would basil — pinch growing tips regularly to produce bushier plants with more leaves. Water regularly, more so in hot weather. If growing in containers, mix equal parts potting soil and composted fine bark. Orchid bark works well.","Pick leaves as needed throughout the summer, and harvest the flowering tops in late summer. As autumn approaches, harvest the seeds for planting next spring."
Stevia,Herb,"Sow indoors 8-10 weeks before last frost, or direct sow in late spring. Seeds should sprout in 10-16 days.","Sow seeds on the surface of damp, sterile seed mix, and use bottom heat. Warmth and bright light are necessary for germination. Be advised that germination is challenging. The germination rate shown on our packaging reflects laboratory conditions. Without the use of bottom heat, few or none of the seeds will germinate. We highly recommend using a heat mat.","Grow using the same methods as growing basil. Grow in well drained soil in a warm spot in the garden, or in large containers in full sun. Water regularly in hot, dry weather. In very hot climates, Stevia benefits from afternoon shade. Space plants 60cm (24"") apart, and pinch growing tips once or twice to encourage bushy growth.","Clip leaves or branches as needed throughout summer. The leaves dry fairly well for fall and winter use as an all purpose, low calorie sweetener."
Tarragon,Herb,"Sow indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost, or direct sow 2 weeks after last frost. If starting indoors, just cover the seeds with vermiculite and provide a soil temperature of 21-25°C (70-75°F). Seeds should sprout in 4-14 days at that temperature.","The seedlings are somewhat prone to damping off. As a precaution, just cover the small seeds with vermiculite, water from below, and provide ventilation in the room. Space plants in the garden 30-45cm (12-18″) apart.","Pinch the growing tips to encourage branching. Edible flowers are borne in abundance once the summer heats up. This fast growing herb requires little care, but it does appreciate good drainage.",Pick leaves and flowers to steep as tea or as a substitute for traditional tarragon at any time during the summer. A yellow dye can be created from the flowers of this plant. The dried plant was traditionally burned to repel insects.
Thyme,Vegetable,"Sow indoors late winter to mid-spring. Transplant out once soil begins to warm, or direct sow late May through June. Ideal soil temperature for germination: 15-21°C (60-70°F).","Sow the dust-like seeds on the surface of dampened, sterilized seed starting mix under bright light with bottom heat. Keep watering to a minimum, as thyme seedlings are prone to damping off. When seedlings are large enough, harden them off and transplant to the garden or to containers, spacing them at 23-38cm (9-15″) apart.","Trim plants back after flowering to encourage bushy growth. Protect container-grown plants from cold as winter approaches, and water only as necessary. Damp, cold soil will kill thyme.","Fresh thyme leaves can be harvested at any time of the year as long as the plants are established. Prune back any dead branches. Whole stems/branches can be clipped and dried whole, or individual leaves can be left to dry in a dark, airy spot for long term storage."
Artichoke,Vegetable,"Start indoors in late winter, four to six weeks before the last frost date. Keep seedlings under bright lights.","Sow two seeds per pot, 5mm (¼”) deep. Keep moist in a warm place until seeds germinate in 10 to 21 days. Transplant seedlings into the garden 2 weeks after the last average frost date for your area. Artichokes need a cool period (250 hours — approximately 10 to 11 days) below 10°C (50°F) to induce flowering in the first year, but will not survive hard frost. Space plants 1m (3′) apart. Seeds can also be germinated between damp sheets of paper towel.","Ideal pH: 5.6-6.6. Select a sunny, sheltered location with well-draining soil. Dig in lots of compost or rotted manure and add 1/2 to 1 cup of  per plant. Approximately two weeks before the last frost date (or if hard frost is forecast) cut the plants back to 15cm (6″) tall, and mulch well with straw, soil, leaves, or burlap, to keep the roots from freezing. Uncover after the last frost date. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant.In optimum conditions at least 70% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 1 year.",Cut individual flowers before they start to open in late summer.
Arugula,Vegetable,"Direct sow every 3 weeks from mid-March to April and again in September for a fall/winter crop. Arugula is a productive, cool season, annual salad green that works best in spring and fall, and can be managed all winter under cloche protection where winters are mild. In hot weather, arugula tends to bolt and go to seed. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 4-12°C (40-50°F).",Sow no more than 5mm (¼”) deep in well drained soil in full sun. Thin seedlings to 10-15cm (4-6″) apart in rows 45-60cm (18-24″) apart. Overcrowded plants will bolt earlier. Seeds germinate in 4-8 days.,Ideal pH: 6.5-7.0. In optimum conditions at least 75% of seeds will germinate. Keep moist until germinated and then just keep the area weeded.,Harvest with scissors. Use as a cut & come again crop. Baby leaves are mild and tender.
Bean,Vegetable,"Direct sow before the first frost date in mild winter areas. Direct sow late winter to mid-spring in other areas (tall, soft plants won’t withstand winter well). Optimal soil temperature: 10-21°C (50-70°F). Enrich the soil with compost prior to planting.","Use a broad bean or combination inoculant to provide a source of nitrogen. Sow seed 5cm (2″) deep, 15cm (6″) apart in double rows. Each set of double rows should be 1m (3’) apart. Germination takes 10-14 days, depending on conditions.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5.Keep overwintered plants weeded. Provide stakes or strings between rows to stop plants from falling over. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimum conditions at least 75% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 2-3 years. Per 100′ row: 450 seeds, per acre: 98M seeds.","Pick when the pods appear plump and begin to droop from the weight of the seeds. Shell (like peas) and cook or use in soup. For dried beans, wait until the pods start to shrivel."
Beets,Vegetable,"Direct sow 4 weeks after last frost to mid-summer. Beets will not produce roots if planted when the soil is too cold. Seeds will germinate in 5-12 days, depending on soil temperature. Optimal soil temperature: 10-26°C (50-80°F).","Sow 1cm (½”) deep, 5-10cm (2-4″) apart in rows 30-45cm (12-18″) apart.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8.For uniformly sized beets, thin carefully to 7-15cm (3-6″) apart when seedlings are 5cm (2″) tall.

Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 600-1M seeds, per acre: 436M seeds.","Harvest at any size. For the best flavour, pull the beets as soon as they have reached full-size. Eat the greens too! Store in the ground, or in moist peat or sand just above freezing."
Broccoli,Vegetable,"Start indoors right around the last frost date or later in spring for summer harvest in 2 to 3 months. For fall harvest, start indoors late spring and transplant in July, harvesting just before the first frost date. For overwintering sprouting broccoli , start indoors late March to mid-April, and harvest the following February to May. Seeds will germinate in 7-10 days. Optimal temperature for germination: 10-30°C (50-85°F).","Sow indoors, 3 or 4 seeds per pot, 5mm (¼”) deep, under very bright light. Thin to the strongest plant. Space transplants 45-60cm (18-24″) apart in rows 75-90cm (30-36″) apart.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Broccoli is a moderate to heavy feeder that does best in humus-rich soil amended with composted manure. Mix ¼-½ cup complete organic fertilizer into the soil under each transplant. Transplants should be set out by the time they have 6-8 true leaves. When plants are 20-25cm (8-10″) tall, push soil around the stems up to the first big leaf to encourage side shoots. Broccoli does best in cool weather. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimum conditions at least 80% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years.

Brussels Sprout,Vegetable,"The goal is to harvest mature sprouts after they have been kissed by frost. Seeds can be directly sown any time once the daytime temperature is steadily above 10°C (50°F). Otherwise, start the seeds in small pots or transplant beds and transplant into the garden so the plants are in the ground for 45-60 days before the first hard frost. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 10-30°C (50-85°F). Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days.","Sow 3-4 seeds per pot, 1cm (1/2”) deep, under very bright light. Thin to the strongest plant. Transplants should be set out when they have 6-8 true leaves. Space transplants 45-60cm (18-24″) apart in rows 75-90cm (30-36″) apart.","Ideal pH: 6.0-7.5.Plant in humus-rich soil amended with composted manure. Mix ¼ cup complete organic fertilizer into the soil under each transplant. High nitrogen levels result in loose sprouts with internal browning, so do not fertilize after midsummer. Cool temperatures during sprout development are important for compact, quality sprouts. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimum conditions at least 80% of seeds will sprout. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 170 seeds, per acre: 30M seeds.","Sprouts are sweeter after moderate freezes. Pick when sprouts are firm and well-formed, beginning with the ones at the bottom. The upper sprouts continue to form and enlarge as the bottom ones are harvested. For a once-over harvest, to ensure you have enough for your holiday meal, pinch out the growing point at the top of the stem when the lower sprouts are 1-2 cm (½-¾”) in diameter. A full stem of evenly sized sprouts will develop in about 2 weeks.After harvesting the sprouts, there may be another harvest in early spring where winters are mild. The plant sends up long, edible flower stalks which are tender and sweet when steamed, or served raw with a dip."
Bush Bean,Vegetable,"Direct sow mid-to late spring. Try to plant during a warm, dry spell. Soil must be warm—if it is not warm enough, seeds may rot, especially since our seeds are not treated with fungicide. Sow drying beans as early as possible, so they can mature before rainy/cold weather sets in. Optimal soil temperature: 21-2°C (70-90°F). Seeds will sprout in 8-16 days, depending on conditions.","Sow bush bean seeds 2-5cm (1-2”) deep, 5-8cm (2-3”) apart, in rows 45-60cm (18-24”) apart. Thin to at least 15cm (6”) apart in each row. If the weather is too wet, beans can also be started in pots indoors and set out carefully a few weeks later. For a longer harvest, plant at 3 week intervals.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5Well drained, warm soil in full sun is best. Use 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer for every 3m (10′) of row. Raised beds help with both drainage and warmth.  Too much nitrogen fertilizer is often the cause of poor pod set and delayed maturity. If the plants flower but do not set pods, the cause may be zinc deficiency. Try spraying the plants with kelp-based fertilizer.  GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 75% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 800 seeds. Per acre: 232M seeds.","Pick beans regularly to keep the plant producing (if pods get fat with seed, the plant will stop flowering). The smaller the bean, the more tender they are."
Cabbage,Vegetable,Sow indoors beginning in late winter and transplant outdoors from 2 weeks after the last frost date to early summer. Overwintering cabbage is sown outdoors during July where winters are mild. Optimal soil temperature: 10-30°C (50-85°F). Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days.,"Sow 3 or 4 seeds per pot, 5mm (¼”) deep, under very bright light. Thin to the strongest plant.

Mix ½ cup complete organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant. If growth slows, side dress with a little more balanced organic fertilizer. Heads of early varieties can split from over-maturity, rapid growth after heavy rain, or irrigation after dry spells. Splits can be delayed by twisting the plant or cultivating deeply next to plants in order to break roots and slow growth. Fall and winter varieties stand in the garden longer without splitting. If direct sown, add 20-25 days to the maturity date.If cabbages won’t form heads, it may be from an imbalance of too much nitrogen in the soil in relation to phosphorus. Cabbages require cool temperatures to form heads well. Hot weather can interfere with the development of heads. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimum conditions at least 80% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 200 seeds, per acre: 44M seeds.","Cabbage heads are ready when they’re firm to the touch, and when the interior is fairly dense. Heads will split when they’re allowed to overly mature. Rapid growth due to excess watering and fertility will also cause splitting of the head. Plant early, mid-season and late varieties to spread out your harvest. Late varieties tend to be better for storage or for making sauerkraut. Early (summer harvest) varieties tend not to store as well."
Carrot,Vegetable,,"Because carrot seeds are tiny, they need to be sown shallowly. The trick is to keep the top-most layer of soil damp during the relatively long germination period. Water deeply prior to planting. Direct sow the tiny seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, 4 seeds per 2cm (1″), and firm soil lightly after seeding. Make sure the seeds are only just buried. Water the area with the gentlest stream possible, and keep it constantly moist until the seeds sprout.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. The softer and more humus-based the soil, the better. When soil is dry enough in spring, work it to a fine texture. Broadcast and dig in ½ cup complete organic fertilizer for every 3m (10′) of row. Avoid fresh manure. Carrots will become misshapen, but still edible if they hit anything hard as they grow down into the soil. Keep weeded and watered. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 60% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 2.4M seeds, per acre: 1,044M seeds. Rates are for raw, not pelleted seeds. ThinningThis is the process of removing some seedlings, if necessary, so each has enough space to grow in the row. It is very important to thin carrots so they don’t compete for available nutrients, moisture, and light. Thin to 4-10cm (1½-4″) apart when the young plants are 2cm (1″) tall. Use wider spacing to get larger roots. As they grow, carrots may push up, out of the soil, so hill soil up to prevent getting a green shoulder.","Carrots can be harvested at any size, but flavour is best when the carrot has turned bright orange (or its other mature colour). After harvest, store at cold temperatures just above 0ºC. Store in sand or sawdust, or simply leave carrots under heaped soil in the garden during the winter, and pull as needed."
Cauliflower,Vegetable,"Start indoors four weeks before the last frost to late spring. Transplant in 5-6 weeks. Direct seed when temperatures are reliably above 10°C (50°F). Overwintering types are started in July where winters are mild, and transplanted by mid-August. Optimal soil temperature: 10-30°C (50-85°F). Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days.",Sow 3-4 seeds 5mm (¼”) deep in each spot you want a plant to grow. Thin to the strongest plant. Space transplants 45-60cm (18-24″) apart in rows 60-90cm (24-36″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8.Humus-rich soil amended with composted manure is best. Mix ½ cup of complete organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant. From seedling to harvest, cauliflower must grow steadily to make a large plant and curd. If growth slows, scratch additional fertilizer into the surface of the soil around each plant. Maintain even soil moisture with regular watering. Shade the developing curds from sun by tying up leaves or using newspaper. This is known as “blanching,” and will keep them white. Add 20-25 days to the maturity dates if direct sowing. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions, at least 80% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 200 seeds, per acre: 44M seeds.","Once curd forms, check every day and cut when the florets are just beginning to separate. At this point the flavour is at peak quality and the size is maximum."
Celary,Vegetable,Start indoors in late winter to mid-spring. Optimal soil temperature: 15-24°C (60-75°F). Seeds take up to 20-30 days for germination.,"Sow seeds no more than 5mm (¼”) deep, 3 seeds per pot, and thin to the strongest plant.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5.Celery is a heavy feeder and needs rich, moist soil. Add compost to soil and apply ¼-½ cup of complete organic fertilizer per 1.5m (5′) of row. Transplant when seedlings are 10-12cm (4-5″) tall. Avoid transplanting until night time temperatures are reliably at 10°C (50°F) or warmer. Space transplants 30cm (12″) apart in rows at least 45cm (18″) apart. Water frequently. Premature bolting may result from young plants being exposed to temperatures below 13°C (55°F) for several days. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions at least 55% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years.","For best flavour and longer storage, water plants the day before harvest. Stalks on the outside of the plant can be harvested at any time. The entire plant may be harvested once the desired size is reached, but the home gardener should leave the plant in the garden and take only what is needed, leaving the root intact. If winter is not too cold, celery will stand in the garden until spring, allowing for light pickings for soups and salads."
Chard,Vegetable,Direct sow any time from early spring to mid-summer. Chard is moderately winter hardy and may perform into the following spring where winters are mild. Optimal soil temperature: 10-30°C (50-85°F). Seeds should sprout in 7-14 days.,"Sow seeds 1cm (½”) deep, spaced 10-30cm (4-12″) apart in rows 45cm (18″) apart.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5. Swiss chard prefers loose, deep, and fertile soil that is rich in organic matter. Plenty of consistent moisture is required, especially as plants grow larger. It grows best in full sun, but will tolerate light shade in summer. A liquid fertilizer or compost tea applied twice during summer will keep chard growing well. GerminationDays to Maturity:From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 75% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 220 seeds, per acre: 64M seeds.","For salad mix, seed more densely and cut as baby leaves. Cut individual mature stalks using the large outer ones first."
Corn,Vegetable,"Direct sow in late spring. If the soil is not warm enough, seeds often rot before sprouting – especially when not treated with fungicide. Untreated corn seeds should be planted only when the soil has warmed up above 18°C (65°F) – warmer for super-sweet (sh2) types, and even warmer for a good stand. Use a soil thermometer. If spring weather is cold, consider planting in flats or individual pots, indoors with bottom heat, for transplanting. Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days. If it rains after planting and corn does not emerge, just re-plant the area.","Do not soak corn seeds prior to planting. Plant 2-5cm (1-2″) deep (shallower for sh2 seed or in cool soil). Sow seeds around 7.5cm (3″) apart, in rows 60-90cm (24-36″) apart. Because corn is wind pollinated, plant in a dense block of at least 4 rows, rather than in single rows. This increases the chance of corn pollen, which emerges from male flowers at the growing tip, to fall down onto the receptive female silks that extend from each corn cob.","Ideal pH: 5.8-6.8. Corn is a heavy feeder, so add manure or compost, and use 500g (1 lb) of complete organic fertilizer per 6m (60′) of row, mixing it thoroughly into the soil beneath each seed furrow. Thin to at least 20-25cm (8-10″) apart in the row. Large eared and double-eared varieties need to be 30cm (24″) apart. Keep free of weeds until knee-high, and then leave it alone. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 85% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 2 years. Per 100′ row: 400 seeds, per acre: 87M seeds.","When the silks at the end of an ear are a dry brown, the cob seems to start to droop, and the kernels release milky juice when cut. Harvesting PopcornLeave the ears of popcorn varieties on the plants to dry as long as possible into late summer and early fall. The husks should turn yellow/brown as they dry and the kernels should harden. Once the plants appear to be completely dry, or if wet weather is in the forecast, harvest the ears and bring them indoors. Remove the husks. Store the ears in mesh bags in a warm, dry, airy location. The ideal humidity level for curing popcorn is 13 to 14%. Curing is the process after drying that allows for long term storage of popcorn kernels. Once a week, remove a few kernels and try popping them. Popcorn that is chewy or kernels that have jagged edges after popping both mean that the kernels are not dry enough. Continue curing and test-popping until the desired texture is reached. Then remove the kernels and store them in an air-tight container."
Corn Salad,Vegetable,"Sow corn salad in early spring and again in September for fall and winter harvests. Ideal temperature: 5-18°C (45-65°F). Seeds sprout best in cool, moist soil. Seeds germinate in 7-21 days.",Sow 3 seeds per inch 1cm (½”) deep in rows 30cm (12″) apart. Thin to 5cm (2”) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.5-7.0. Grow in light, fertile soil . Corn salad grows best on fertilizer remaining in the bed after summer crops have been harvested, so it’s perfect for following any crop that ends in September, like bush beans or lettuce. Try filling a raised bed with corn salad for fall & winter harvests: Fifty feet of planted row will provide a big bowl of tender leaves harvested once a week. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimum conditions at least 75% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100’ row: 3600 seeds, per acre: 257.4M seeds.","Delicately bunch small groups of leaves together and cut with a sharp knife 2-5cm (1-2″) above the soil, so the plants can grow back. Or sow very densely, and gradually thin the plants throughout winter, cutting them at the soil line. Corn salad leaves frequently come in contact with soil, so rinse them thoroughly."
Cress,Vegetable,Seed every three weeks from just before the last frost date until the end of summer for a continuous harvest. Provide frost protection with a cloche or heavy row cover when frost looms in the fall. Many mesclun types and mixes will continue to grow all winter where winters are mild.,"Plant in a block or in a wide row. Sprinkle the seeds evenly over prepared, moist soil. Try to space seeds about 1cm (½”) apart. Cover lightly with soil, and firm them in. Four grams of seed will plant a 12m (40′) row that is 7cm (3″) wide, so don’t plant the whole packet at once. For container growing, choose containers that are at least 10cm (4″) deep. Wider is better. The most common mistake is over-planting.","Moderately fertile soil – particularly if you’re planning mutliple harvests. Dig in 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer for every 3m (10′) of row. For containers, use peat or coir based mix with compost added. Water regularly. If growth slows after harvest, use a bit of kelp or fish based fertilizer to provide a boost of nutrition for the next growth spurt.","There are two methods of gathering salad greens. You can use scissors to cut everything about 2-5cm (1-2″) from the ground, when the plants are about 10-15cm (3-4″) tall. Or, you can pick individual leaves as they’re needed. The first cutting may contain more brassicas than lettuces (arugula, mizuna) but if you cut the mix back when the leaves are still small, the lettuce will catch up. The salad greens will regrow for a second harvest in another 2 or 3 weeks."
Cucumber,Vegetable,"Cucumbers need very warm soil to germinate. If direct sowing, wait until mid-June. If weather turns cool and wet after that, just re-sow. Or start transplants indoors in individual peat or coir pots 3-4 weeks before transplanting out into warm soil. If starting indoors, use bottom heat. Transplant when the plants develop their third true leaf. If the plants are too big, they may experience transplant shock. Optimal soil temperature for germination (and transplanting): 15-30°C (60-85°F).",Sow 3-4 seeds 2cm (1″) deep in each spot you want a plant to grow. Thin to the strongest seedling. Space plants 23cm (9″) apart in rows 90cm (36″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Choose a warm, well-drained soil. Raised beds work well. Add diolomite lime and compost or well-rotted manure to the bed and ½-1 cup of complete organic fertilizer mixed into the soil beneath each transplant. Cucumbers are vigorous and need lots of nutrition and water. Use plastic mulch, plant under floating row cover or cloches – anything to warm things up. Once the weather warms up, keep soil evenly moist. When plants begin to flower, remove covers so bees can access the flowers to pollinate. Fruit that is not fully pollinated will be very small and shriveled, and should be removed from the plant. Most varieties should produce fruits until the weather begins to cool down. Keep plants well picked for better production. Try to water the soil only, keeping the leaves as dry as possible.Almost all cucumbers benefit from being trained onto a trellis of some kind. Some vines can reach 7 or 8 feet in length, so growing them upward onto a trellis makes good use of garden space. Fruits that grow hanging into space tend to be straighter than those that form on the ground. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions at least 60% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 240 seeds, per acre: 35M seeds.","For a continuous harvest, make successive plantings every 2 to 3 weeks until about 3 months before first fall frost date. Keep picking the cucumbers regularly, because if they get too big, the plant will stop producing. About one month before first frost, start pinching off new flowers so plants channel energy into ripening existing fruit."
Eggplant,Vegetable,"Sow indoors in the four weeks following the last frost date. Use bottom heat, and keep seedlings warm. Optimal soil temperature: 24-32°C (75-90°F). Seeds should sprout in 7-12 days.",Sow seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep. Use individual peat or coir pots to reduce root disturbance when transplanting. Transplant after night time temperatures are steadily 10°C (50°F) or warmer. Space with 45-60cm (18-24″) between plants. Medium size (3-5 gallon) containers for individual plants also work well.,"Ideal pH: 5.5-6.0. Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium, so add lime and compost to the soil three weeks prior to transplanting. Mix ¼-½ cup of complete organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant. Using a clear plastic cloche or floating row cover helps growth by increasing heat. Cool temperatures increase leafy growth, but delay fruit set. Once most eggplants get going in the summer, they are highly productive right up until the first frosts. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions at least 65% of the seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years.","Pinch off blossoms 2 to 4 weeks before first expected frost so that plants focus on ripening any existing fruit, not producing new ones. Harvest the fruit anytime after the fruit reaches half of their size. Harvesting early prevents fruit from becoming too seedy, and will encourage more production from the plants.Do not pull the fruit off the plant, but cut it with scissors or secateurs, being careful to avoid any sharp spurs at the stem end."
Endive,Vegetable,"Sow after the last frost date and again in mid-summer to take advantage of the fall growing season. Optimal soil temperature: 10-22°C (50-72°F). Seeds sprout in 2-15 days, depending on conditions. In hot weather plants may go to seed quickly, so have new plantings ready to go.","Either direct seed or start indoors and transplant. Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, and thin or transplant to allow 30-45cm (12-18″) between plants in rows 30-45cm (12-18″) apart.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5.Enrich soil with compost and add ¼ cup balanced organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant. Rapid, continuous growth is essential for good yields and high quality. Regular watering is essential.Fall plantings can be protected from rain by putting a cloche over them. Endive heads can be blanched to reduce bitterness by placing a cardboard or plastic disc on top. Radicchio requires a good supply of phosphorus and potassium, but will not head and may bolt if there is too much nitrogen available. Days to maturity shown are from date of direct sowing. If transplanting, subtract 10-15 days. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 65% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 140 seeds, per acre: 40.6M seeds.",Use as a cut and come again crop or let the heads develop and cut at ground level. Many will grow back.
Fennel,Vegetable,Start indoors 4 weeks before the last frost date in individual peat or coir pots. Fennel dislikes root disturbance. Transplant (or direct sow rows) 4 weeks after last frost in succession to mid-summer. Ideal temperature for germination: 15-21°C (60-70°F). Seeds should sprout in 10-14 days.,"Sow seeds 1cm (1/2”) deep, a few seeds where each plant is to grow. Thin or space to 20-30cm (8-12”) in rows 45cm (18”) apart.","Ideal pH: 5.5-7.0. Rich, well-drained soil produces the best bulbs. Transplant when seedlings are 5cm (2″) tall. If raising transplants, do not disturb the roots, as this may cause plants to bolt. Keep well watered to ensure succulent bulbs and prevent bolting. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions 80% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 2 years. Per 100′ row: 240 seeds, per acre: 53M seeds.","Use a knife to slice the bulb from the root when it has thickened to 5cm (2″) or more across. If this is done carefully, smaller bulbs will sprout from the root later."
Kale and Collards,Vegetable,"Direct sow in early spring to mid-summer for summer to winter harvests. Or start indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost, and transplant out as soon as the soil warms up. Optimal soil temperature: 10-30°C (50-85°F). Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days.",Sow 3-4 seeds 5mm (¼”) deep in each spot you where a plant is to grow. Thin to the strongest plant. Space 45-60cm (18-24″) apart in rows 75-90cm (30-36″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Add lime to the bed 3 weeks prior to sowing. Kale likes well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter. This plant prefers plentiful, consistent moisture. Drought is tolerable, but quality and flavor of leaves can suffer. Mix ¼ cup of complete organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant, or use 1 cup beneath every 3m (10′) of seed furrow. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimum conditions, at least 80% of seeds will germinate.","Kale and collards can both be grown as a cut and come again crop for salad mixes by direct-seeding and cutting when plants are 5-8cm (2-3″) tall. They will re-grow. Or pick leaves from the bottom up on mature plants as you need them. In spring, the surviving plants start to flower, so eat the delicious flowering steps and buds."
Kholrabi,Vegetable,"Direct sow several times during the four to six weeks after the last frost date for a crop to mature starting in about 8 weeks. Sow again after mid-July to early August for fall and winter crops. Planting between mid-May and mid-July causes kohlrabi to mature in hot weather, resulting in inferior bulbs. In short season areas, start kohlrabi indoors in cell trays about 4 weeks before the last frost date and transplant out once day time temperatures are steadily above 10°C (50°F). Optimal soil temperature for germination: 10-30°C (50-85°F). Seeds should germinate in 7-10 days.",Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep with plants spaced 10-15cm (4-6″) apart in rows 30-45cm (12-18″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Kohlrabi is a moderate to heavy feeder that does best in humus-rich soil amended with composted manure. Mix ¼-½ cup complete organic fertilizer into the soil under each plant. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions, at least 80% of the seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 360 seeds, per acre: 104M seeds.","Spring-sown kohlrabi will get larger than tennis balls in fair soil, but if you pick them when they are still less than 5-8cm (2-3″) in diameter they will be sweet and tender. Fall-grown kohlrabi can grow larger yet stay tender. Kohlrabi is frost-hardy, and may last well beyond Christmas in mild winter areas."
Lettuce,Vegetable,"Lettuce grows best in cool weather in the spring and fall, but it can be grown in the summer, and all winter long in milder regions. Sow short rows every 2-3 weeks following the last average frost date for a continual harvest. Using a cloche, cold frame, or greenhouse over mid-late summer plantings can extend the harvest period right into winter. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 10-22°C (50-72°F). Seeds should sprout in 7-15 days, depending on conditions. Lettuce seeds don’t sprout easily when the soil temperature is over 22°C (72°F) in summer. Get around this by sprouting them indoors in a cool area, or pre-sprout by sprinkling seeds on a damp paper towel and placing it in a plastic bag in the fridge for a few days. In hot weather most lettuce goes to seed rapidly, so have new plantings ready to go, and watch for ""good resistance to bolting"" in the product description.","Direct sow or start indoors and transplant. Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, or on the surface of the soil where the soil can be kept evenly moist. Space or thin heading lettuce to 30cm (12″) apart. Space or thin looseleaf varieties to 20-25cm (8-10″) apart. Space rows for all types 45-90cm (18-36″) apart. Babyleaf lettuce can be planted quite densely, as it is harvested at an immature size. Sowing babyleaf lettuce seeds closely together in narrow rows makes harvesting simpler.: A number of our lettuce seeds are pelleted for machine planting. The white clay ball that covers each seed makes them easier to handle and easier to see when planted. While most lettuce seeds need to be barely covered (or sown on the surface of the soil), pelleted seeds need to be buried by about 1cm (1/2″). Please keep your newly sown pelleted seeds evenly moist – use more water than with conventional seeds. If the soil is allowed to dry out, the clay pelleting material can wick water away from the seed, causing uneven or lower germination.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5. Aim for a soil with ample drainage and lots of organic matter. Add compost and lime at least 3 weeks prior to planting. One cup of balanced organic fertilizer per 3m (10′) of row will give adequate nutrition. Seedlings should be hardened off by reducing water and putting the plants outdoors 2 or 3 days before transplanting. This will help to prevent transplant shock and premature bolting. Regular watering is essential to prevent leaves from developing a bitter taste.  GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing. Most varieties will be ready for harvesting as baby leaves in half the days shown on the packet.In optimal growing conditions at least 70% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 240 seeds head lettuce/1.2M seeds leaf type, per acre: 58M seeds head lettuce/348M leaf type.","Pick individual leaves or wait and harvest full heads. Mature summer lettuce stays in prime eating condition only a short time, so harvest promptly and keep planting. In fall and winter the plants stay in good harvest condition longer."
Microgreens,Vegetable,"Timing microgreens depends on the individual kinds of greens you will be growing. Cress grows really fast, and can be harvested a few days after sowing. Carrot seeds can take as long as 2 to 3 weeks to germinate, so you should expect to allow extra time.Microgreens can be grown at any time of the year as long as you can supply enough light.","Follow the planting instructions for each variety of seeds. For instance, some seeds prefer to be sown on the surface of the soil, while others need to be covered. We recommend using sterilized seed starting soil in shallow trays that have drainage holes at the bottom. You could try growing microgreens in 12-cell plug inserts that have been inserted into seedling germination trays. You can also grow microgreens in recycled plastic containers or clamshell packaging, as long as you poke some drainage holes in the bottom. Using a seedling warmer will increase the speed of germination, but it is not strictly necessary.Spread the sterilized soil to a depth of only 2-3 inches. You’ll be harvesting the baby seedlings, so they don’t need a lot of room to grow roots.Sow microgreen seeds fairly densely, a little less dense for large seeds like sunflowers. Once your microgreen seeds have been planted, mist the whole area. You want to keep the soil moist like a wrung out sponge, but not sitting in water. Keep your mist sprayer handy, and spritz the soil regularly. The nice thing about using seedling germination trays is that you can take a second tray and invert it over the planted tray. This traps moisture inside, and prevents rapid evaporation.","As soon as the first sprout is visible above the soil, remove the tray from the seedling warmer (if using), and remove the cover (if using). Bright light is essential for growing microgreens. From late spring to early autumn, microgreens can be grown outdoors under daylight conditions. But indoors, you will need to provide some kind of supplemental light, particularly in the short, dim days of winter. The Growlight Garden is one of the best microgreen growing systems we have found. It even has a self-watering mechanism, which makes the whole process much easier. But any way you can provide light from T5 fluourescent tubes or other grow lights will work. Aim for full spectrum lights.This bright light will help keep your microgreens short and stout. When light is insufficient, the sprouts will grow long and spindly.","Microgreens can be pulled from the soil and rinsed until all the soil particles have washed away. They can be enjoyed whole, roots and all. Or simply trim them with scissors and dispose of the used soil in your compost.Microgreens are intended to be harvested when the first leaf pair (the cotyledon, or seed leaf) opens fully and turns green. This is the point at which your microgreens will be richest in nutrients. However, you can also let the seedlings continue to grow and harvest them as needed. Be aware that the longer they are left to grow the more roots will also develop in the soil."
Mustard,Vegetable,Mustards are cool season plants that grow quickly and then bolt. Direct sow with frost protection as early as late winter or without protection from early to late spring. Sowing short rows every 3 weeks allows for a continuous harvest of both baby leaves and full sized plants. Sow again in late summer for late fall and winter harvests. Optimal soil temperature: 21°C (70°F). Seeds should sprout in 5-10 days.,"If growing to full size, sow 3-4 seeds in each spot you want a plant to grow. Sow 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep and thin to the strongest plant, spaced 10-15cm (4-6″) in the row. All mustards can be grown in containers for baby salad greens. Sow these as you would mesclun mixes, with seeds spaced as near as possible to 1cm (½”) apart.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5. One cup of complete organic fertilizer will provide nutrition for 3m (10′) of row. Water regularly. Expect mustards to bolt in hot weather. Provide protection in winter by using a cloche or heavy row cover. At all other times, plan on growing fast and harvesting fast, like spinach. Planting short rows every two weeks works best for the home garden for a constant harvest. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing. In optimal conditions at least 70% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 400 seeds, per acre: 174M seeds.","Cut individual leaves, or the whole plant at whatever stage of maturity you desire. Young leaves tend to be more tender and less powerfully flavoured as mature leaves. Some varieties will develop a slight bitterness in fully mature leaves. The leaves can be blanched (or run through a food processor) and then frozen, or even dried and flaked for soup mixes. But the plants are so cold hardy, fresh leaves should be available to the determined gardener 12 months of the year. Whole plants can also be pickled for long term storage."
Pac Choi and Choi Sum,Vegetable,"All are cool season plants that grow quickly and then bolt. Direct sow with frost protection (a cloche or heavy row cover) as early as late winter, or without protection from four weeks before the last frost date to eight weeks after. Sowing short rows every 2-3 weeks allows for a fairly constant harvest time. Sow again in late summer, and provide frost protection as the first frost date approaches.",Sow 3-4 seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep in each spot you want a plant to grow. Thin to the strongest plant at a spacing of 15-20cm (6-6″) between plants in rows 30-45cm (12-18″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer will provide sufficient nutrition to 3m (10′) of row. Choi Sum is harvested just before it flowers, so keep a close watch on each row. Pac Choi can be harvested at any stage, but if you want full-sized plants, watch for signs of bolting. Flower buds will appear at the centre of each plant, and a stem will form quickly as the plant turns from urn-shaped into a tall cone. Harvest as quickly as possible once flower buds are visible. Keep plants well-watered throughout their growth. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 70% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 260 seeds, per acre: 114M seeds.","Use a sharp knife to cut the plants at ground level when they are ready to harvest. They will not grow back like some other crops, so plant several short rows every couple of weeks for a longer harvest."
Parsnip,Vegetable,Direct sow from the last frost date to mid-summer. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 10-25°C (50-75°F). Seeds take 14-21 days to germinate.,Sow seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep. Cover seeds with compost and/or put row cover over planting area to shade the soil and conserve moisture. Thin to 7-10 cm (3-4″) apart in rows 45-60cm (18-24″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Prepare ground as for carrots, digging deeply to loosen soil prior to planting For even longer parsnips, you can dig or form holes 60cm (24″) deep. Weed carefully and keep watered. Contact with parsnip leaves causes a rash in some people, so harvest and weed with long sleeves and gloves. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 60% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 1 year. Per 100′ row: 440 seeds, per acre: 128M seeds.",The flavour of parsnips is best after a couple of good frosts. Dig parsnips from late summer into the winter as needed. Protect from freezing in the soil with a thick straw mulch if it is a cold winter. Parsnips keep better in well-drained soil. The average family will be well supplied with a 6m (20′) row.
Pepper,Vegetable,"Peppers need plenty of time to mature before they will bloom and set fruit. Start indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost date, and grow under bright lights. Transplant only when weather has really warmed up. Night time low temperatures should be consistently above 12°C (55°F) before hardening off pepper plants and transplanting outdoors. Soil temperature for germination: 25-29°C (78-85°F). Seeds should sprout in 10 – 21 days.","Sow indoors 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep. Keep soil as warm as possible. Seedling heating mats speed germination. Try to keep seedlings at 18-24°C (64-75°F) in the day, and 16-18°C (61-64°F) at night. Before they become root-bound, transplant them into 8cm (3″) pots. For greatest possible flower set, try to keep them for 4 weeks at night, about 12°C (55°F). Then transplant them into 15cm (6″) pots, bringing them into a warm room at night, about 21°C (70°F).","Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium, so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting. Mix ½ cup of balanced organic fertilizer beneath each plant. Though peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist. Harden off before planting out 30-60cm (12-24″) apart. Five gallon containers also work well, but require good drainage and regular irrigation. Using plastic mulch with a cloche can increase the temperature by a few degrees. Pinch back growing tips to encourage leaf production. This helps shade the developing fruits and prevents sun-scald in hot summers. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions at least 65% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 2 years.","When the fruit is large and firm it is ready to pick. Or wait for the fruit to ripen further turning red, yellow, brown, or purple. The sweetness and vitamin C content go up dramatically as the fruit changes colour. If you pick green, the total numbers of peppers harvested will increase. Fruit that sets after late August will not usually develop or ripen. Pull out the entire bush just before the first frost and hang it upside down in a warm, dry place to ripen hot peppers. "
Pole Bean,Vegetable,"Direct sow from late spring to early summer. Try to plant during a warm, dry spell. Soil must be warm – if it is not warm enough, seeds may rot, especially our untreated seeds. Optimal soil temperature: 21-32°C (70-90°F).","Seeds can be started indoors, or sowed directly. Set seeds 7-10cm (3-4″) apart and 3.5cm (1½”) deep at the base of a support. Plants will climb by twining around almost anything. Try rough poles, lumber, re-bar, or build a strong trellis 2-2.5m (6-8′) tall. Seeds will sprout in 8-16 days, depending on soil conditions. ","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5Well drained, warm soil in full sun is best. Use 1 cup of balanced organic fertilizer for every 3m (10′) of row. Too much nitrogen in fertilizer or manure is often the cause of poor pod set and delayed maturity. If beans flower but do not set pods, the cause can be zinc deficiency. Try spraying the plants with kelp based fertilizer. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 75% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 400 seeds. Per acre: 43.5M seeds.","Because pole beans are always climbing, there are always beans at different stages of maturity. It is important to keep picking regularly so the plant does not fully mature seeds and stop producing new pods. If pods get fat with seed, the plant will stop flowering. The smaller the bean, the more tender they are."
Quinoa,Vegetable,"Direct sow in spring, while night temperatures are still cool. Night time temperatures should be consistently above 10°C (50°F). Optimal soil temperature for germination: 18-24°C (65-75°F). Seeds should germinate in 4-10 days.","Sow 5mm (¼”) deep, 10 seeds per 30cm (12″), and thin to 25-35cm (10-14″) between plants. If growing for baby leaf production, plants can be spaced more closely.","Ideal pH: 6.0-7.5. Use a well-drained, loamy soil with added organic matter in the form of well-rotted compost or manure. Keep weeded, but otherwise quinoa is drought tolerant and undemanding. It’s a great plant for xeriscaping, and the tall plants look good at the back of a floral border. GerminationFrom direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 70% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Per 100′ row: 160 seeds, per acre: 42M seeds.","Harvest any time after seeds have changed from green to their calico colours, even after light frost. Read more about ."
Radiccio,Vegetable,"Sow after the last frost date and again in mid-summer to take advantage of the fall growing season. Optimal soil temperature: 10-22°C (50-72°F). Seeds sprout in 2-15 days, depending on conditions. In hot weather plants may go to seed quickly, so have new plantings ready to go.","Either direct seed or start indoors and transplant. Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, and thin or transplant to allow 30-45cm (12-18″) between plants in rows 30-45cm (12-18″) apart.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5.Enrich soil with compost and add ¼ cup balanced organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each transplant.

Radish,Vegetable,Radishes can be grown all season but they’re easiest when sown just after the last frost date and again at the end of summer and into the fall. Optimal soil temperature: 18-24°C (65-75°F). Seeds should sprout in 5-7 days.,"Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, 25 seeds per 30cm (12″) in rows spaced 30-45cm (12-18″) apart, and thin to 6-12 plants per 30cm (12″).","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Radishes are moderate to heavy feeders. Best in rich, loamy soil amended with composted manure. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer for every 3m (10′) of row for background fertility. Lime beds the previous fall. The real secret to growing this little vegetable is speed. Sow a short row frequently, thin them quickly, keep them watered, eat them quickly, and sow some more. GerminationFrom direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 80% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 4 years. Per 100′ row: 1.2M seeds, per acre: 522M seeds.",Harvest promptly when radishes are the size of large marbles. The leaves and developing seedpods are also tasty.
Rutabega,Vegetable,Direct sow rutabaga seeds during the period three weeks before or after the summer solstice. Optimal soil temperature: 18-21°C (65-70°F). Seeds should sprout in 7-15 days.,Sow seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep in rows 60-75cm (24-30″) apart. Thin seedlings to 15-20cm (6-8″) apart in each row.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Rutabagas are moderate to heavy feeders that do best in rich, loamy soil amended with composted manure. Add 1 cup complete organic fertilizer beneath each 3m (10′) of row. Lime beds several weeks before planting. Rutabagas appreciate lots of organic matter in the soil. Water generously in hot, dry weather. GerminationDays to Maturity: From direct sowing.At least 60% of seeds should germinate in optimal conditions. Usual seed life: 4 years. Per 100′ row: 300 seeds, per acre: 65.4M seeds.","Pull up rutabagas when they are larger than tennis balls. Store in paper bags in a cool, dry place. Storing in dry sand or peat moss may conserve moisture and freshness. Otherwise, leave in the ground for fall harvesting. Rutabaga leaves are also tasty and nutritious."
Ryegrass,Vegetable,"In Zone 6 or warmer, it makes an excellent fall cover crop, and will hold soil in place over winter. In Zone 5 or cooler, it’s better to sow mid-summer to early fall for spring tilling.","Sow seeds 2-4cm (1-1½"") deep.","After its burst of spring growth, turn ryegrass under or cut it back before it reaches 30cm (12"") tall. Allow three weeks after tilling before planting the next crop. Annual ryegrass can produce 4000-8000 lb of dry matter per acre, and hold up to 60 lb of Nitrogen per acre. It works particularly well in orchards and vineyards as a 50/50 mix with crimson clover.",
Salad Greens,Vegetable,Seed every three weeks from just before the last frost date until the end of summer for a continuous harvest. Provide frost protection with a cloche or heavy row cover when frost looms in the fall. Many mesclun types and mixes will continue to grow all winter where winters are mild.,"Plant in a block or in a wide row. Sprinkle the seeds evenly over prepared, moist soil. Try to space seeds about 1cm (½”) apart. Cover lightly with soil, and firm them in. Four grams of seed will plant a 12m (40′) row that is 7cm (3″) wide, so don’t plant the whole packet at once. For container growing, choose containers that are at least 10cm (4″) deep. Wider is better. The most common mistake is over-planting.","Ideal pH: 7.0 Moderately fertile soil – particularly if you’re planning multiple harvests. Dig in 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer for every 3m (10′) of row. For containers, use peat or coir based mix with compost added. Water regularly. If growth slows after harvest, use a bit of kelp or fish based fertilizer to provide a boost of nutrition for the next growth spurt. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing. ","There are two methods of gathering salad greens. You can use scissors to cut everything about 2-5cm (1-2″) from the ground, when the plants are about 10-15cm (3-4″) tall. Or, you can pick individual leaves as they’re needed. The first cutting may contain more brassicas than lettuces (arugula, mizuna) but if you cut the mix back when the leaves are still small, the lettuce will catch up. The salad greens will regrow for a second harvest in another 2 or 3 weeks."
Sesame,Vegetable,"Sow seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last average frost date. Transplant under cover a similar period after the last frost date. Remove the cover in late spring, once the night time temperatures are consistently above 10°C (50°F). ","Lightly cover the seeds with sterilized, soil-less starter mix, and keep just moist until germination. Don’t keep the seeds in a highly damp environment, and be sure not to over-water the seedlings. Once they sprout, reduce watering to once a week until transplant time. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 21°C (70°F).","If steps are taken to increase warmth in and around the plants, they will be more productive. Try transplanting into a raised bed, or into the ground using black plastic mulch over the soil. Do not fertilize sesame plants, and avoid drip irrigation, as they really do like it dry. Plant fairly densely at 15cm (6″) spacing, in rows 60-45cm (24-36″) wide. Sesame is indeterminate, so it will continue to bloom and set seed capsules until the end of summer. Expect flowering to peak in mid- to late summer.The tubular flowers of the sesame plant are highly attractive to honeybees, and are said to produce some of the highest grade of honey. The plants are relatively self-fruitful, so when the flowers open, the seeds are already fertilized. The seeds are produced in pods (seed capsules) that appear along the stem, appearing from the bottom upward. GerminationDays to Maturity: From transplant date.From a 10 foot long, 2½ foot wide row, expect to harvest approximately 425g (just under one pound) of seeds.","Around the end of summer, some of the pods near the bottom of the stem (the first flowers that opened), may begin to show signs of ripeness. When ripe, the pods begin to split from the blossom end. Don’t worry if this doesn’t happen in the field. Before cold, wet weather arrives, cut the stems at the base and gather them to dry some place that is flat — hanging them will cause the seeds to just fall out as the pods dry. As the plants dry, the foliage will darken and more pods will open from the base of the stem upwards. Once most of the pods have opened, bash them against the sides of a bucket to collect the dry seeds. The seeds are edible at this stage, and resist spoilage better than most nuts. They can also be toasted, pressed for oil, or ground into the paste known as tahini.Sesame plants each produce quite a lot of seeds, but the seeds have little mass. From a 10 foot long, 2½ foot wide row, expect to harvest approximately 425g (just under one pound) of seeds."
Shallot,Vegetable,"Start shallots and storage onions indoors in late winter and early spring, and transplant 2-4 weeks after the last frost date. Overwintering onions need to be started in early summer, and transplanted by the middle of August. Scallions can be direct sown every 3 weeks from two weeks after the last frost date to late summer. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 21-25°C (70-75°F). Seeds will emerge in 6-12 days, depending on conditions.","Transplants are preferred for home gardeners. Sow 3 seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep in each cell of a 72-cell tray. Transplant as a clump, spacing each 15cm (6″) apart in rows 45-75cm (18-30″) apart. Scallions can be spaced at 2-5cm (1-2″) apart in rows 15cm (6″) apart.","Ideal pH: 5.5-6.5 (6.0-6.8 for scallions). Fertile and well-drained soil in full sun is essential. Add well-rotted compost and dig ½-1 cup balanced organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each 3m (10′) of row. Keep moisture high in the top 20-30cm (8-12″) of soil. Most of the bulb should form on the surface of the soil, so don’t transplant too deeply. Bulb size is dependent on the size of the tops: the bigger the tops, the bigger the bulb. Provide August-planted scallions with the frost protection of a cloche or heavy row cover as the first frost date approaches. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions at least 75% of seeds should germinate. Usual seed life: 1 year. Per 100′ row: 260 seeds (scallions 1.2M), per acre: 76M seeds (scallions 1,045M).","Stop watering in the beginning of August to mature the bulbs in dry soil. After half the tops have fallen, push over the remainder, wait a week and lift the bulbs. Curing is essential for long storage: Spread bulbs out in a single layer in an airy spot out of direct sunlight. Once no more green is visible on any of the leaves, and they are dry and crisp, the onion is cured. If weather is poor, cure indoors. Storage: Keep onions in mesh sacks or hang in braids so they get good ventilation, and hang sacks where air is dry and very cool, but not freezing. Check them regularly and remove any sprouting or rotting onions. Well-cured storage onions should keep until late spring."
Snow Peas,Vegetable,"Peas prefer cool weather. Plant as early in spring as the soil can be worked. If planting on the west coast after April 1, sow varieties that are listed as being enation resistant if you live in an area where aphids carry the enation virus. Sow again through the summer for a fall crop. The success of a fall crop will depend on the weather. Optimal soil temperature: 10-20°C (50-70°F). Seeds should sprout in 7-14 days.","Soaking seeds is not advised for damp soils. Sow seed 2cm (1″) deep. After April 15th, sow seed 5cm (2″) deep. Space seeds 2-7cm (1-3″) apart in the row. Do not thin. If the seeds fail to sprout, try to dig some up and check for rot or insect damage. The challenge with untreated pea seeds is to give them an early start but to avoid rot.","Use well-drained soil amended with finished compost. Add 2 cups of rock phosphate or bonemeal for 3m (10′) of row. Plant most varieties along a trellis or fence for support as they climb. Dwarf varieties do not need a trellis, but may benefit from the support of some twigs poked into the soil in the row. GerminationDays to maturity: From direct sowing.","Pick when pods at the desired stage. In theory, all peas can be harvested before the seeds mature, as snow peas, and then as tender snap peas, and finally as shelling peas. Most varieties have an intended maturity for picking. Make multiple sowings or grow several varieties to extend the harvest season.How to Blanch PeasPeas of all kinds freeze particularly well for use in the fall and winter. Prior to freezing, it’s important to briefly submerge peas in boiling water — this kills the natural enzymes that exist in peas that would otherwise reduce the nutrients and cause the peas to break down over time. We recommend using a large pot of water at a rolling boil, and a colander or sieve for dipping. Timing is everything. For snap and snow peas, dip the whole pods into boiling water for exactly two minutes, and then transfer the pods to a bowl of ice water. For shelled peas, ninety seconds is perfect. Use a timer. After ninety seconds, transfer the peas to a bowl of ice water. All peas (and pods) should then be dried thoroughly on kitchen towels before being stored in zip-top or vacuum bags, with as little air as possible in each bag."
Spinach,Vegetable,"Direct sow once soil has warmed up in mid- to late spring. Soaking the seeds for 12 hours prior to sowing tends to speed up germination. The seeds can also be started indoors before the last average frost date, but wait until the soil really warms up outdoors before transplanting. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 15-24°C (60-75°F).","Sow seeds 1cm (1/2″) deep, and 5-10cm (2-4"") apart. Thin to 30-45cm (12-18″) apart in rows 60-90cm (24-36"") apart.","Ideal pH: 6.8-7.0. This crop performs well in containers. Place 2 plants in each minimum 5 gallon container. Try growing in small hills like squash plants, with one plant per hill. Grow in full sun in moisture-retentive, freely draining soil. Add several scoops of well-rotted compost or manure beneath each plant.  GerminationDays to Maturity: From direct sowing.In optimal conditions at least 50% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 3 years. Be sure to plant the large seeds into warm soil.",One or two plants per household member should supply ample summer harvest greens. Pick immature leaves as needed.
Sprouts,Vegetable,,,,
Squash,Vegetable,"Direct sow or transplant in late May or early June when soil is warm. For transplants, start seeds indoors in late April or early May. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 25-35°C (68-95°F). Seeds should sprout in 7-14 days.",Sow seeds 2cm (1″) deep. Sow 3 seeds in each spot you want a plant to grow and thin to the strongest one. Aim to space zucchinis no less than 45-60cm (18-24″) apart in rows 90-120cm (36-48″) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. These big, fast-growing plants need plenty of moisture and lots of food. Grow them in rich, well-drained soil in full sun. Dig finished compost or well-rotted manure into the beds, and dig in 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer beneath each transplant. Water the soil around them when you irrigate, and always avoid overhead watering, as wet leaves will attract diseases like mildew. Keep weeded. Misshapen or withered fruits can result from incomplete pollination. Make sure to remove these from the plants as you see them, before they begin to rot, and put them in the compost. In the home garden it can be tempting to over-plant zucchinis. One well-grown plant will provide enough fruits for the average family. Instead of planting several zucchinis, use that space for other vegetables. GerminationIn optimal conditions at least 80% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 2 years. Per 100′ row: 180 seeds, per acre: 15M seeds.","Pick regularly to encourage the plant to keep on fruiting. Zucchini leaves are often very prickly, so pull delicate skinned fruit out carefully. Fully mature zucchini have a hard skin."
Tomato,Vegetable,"Start indoors in early spring over bottom heat. When seedlings germinate, remove from the heat and grow under bright lights. Grow seedlings on for 6-8 weeks at around 10°C (50°F). Early season tomatoes can be planted out once night time temperatures are reliably above 7°C (45°F) - or later. Other types should be transplanted out when night time lows are 10°C (50°F) or warmer - or later. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 25-35°C (68-95°F). With bottom heat seeds should germinate in 7-14 days.",Sow seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep. Keep seedlings under very bright light to prevent legginess. You may have to pot on seedlings more than once before they go out to allow for root growth. Space bush (determinate) transplants 45-60cm (18-24″) apart and vine (indeterminate) types 50-75cm (20-30″) apart in rows 1m (3′) apart.,"Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Tomatoes like fertile, well drained soil that is rich in organic matter. Dig in finished compost and manure, and add 1 cup balanced organic fertilizer beneath each transplant. The nutrition from heavy clay soils is excellent for tomatoes, but they are slow to warm, so transplanting should be done later. By the same token, lighter soils warm more quickly, so transplants can go out sooner. Adding glacial rock dust will supply all the calcium they will need. Regular watering is vital, but don’t let the plants sit in water. Tomatoes are tropical plants so they require full sun and lots of heat. Vine varieties will require some kind of support such as a wire to grow up, or a trellis to be tied to as the plant grows. Bush types benefit from the support of a tomato cage in order to prevent sprawling. At the time of final transplant, plants can be buried up to their first pair of true leaves. This will encourage greater root growth, helping with both nutrient uptake and the plants’ ability to stand up to dry conditions.Stop watering around the end of July to encourage the fruit to ripen. If tomato plants are grown under cover, you can encourage pollination and fruit set by tapping the stem from time to time. Tomatoes do not rely on insects for pollination. Vibrating the plant shakes pollen loose within the flowers, which then self-pollinate.Indeterminate tomatoes continue to grow and produce fruit until they are killed by frost. Remove any suckers (stems growing from the crotch of leaves) to keep the foliage under control, and they will set a later crop of larger fruit. Determinate varieties normally set fruit in a concentrated time period. Their suckers are not normally removed, though some trimming helps with ventilation. GerminationDays to Maturity:From transplant date.At least 75% of seeds will germinate in optimal conditions. Usual seed life: 3 years.",Harvest when the fruit is the desired colour. Green tomatoes can be ripened indoors at a cool temperature when they are blemish free. Very dark green tomatoes are unlikely to ripen fully.
Turnip,Vegetable,"Direct sow short rows starting just after the last frost date, through summer, and into the fall. Where winters are mild they can be started right into October. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 18-21°C (66-70°F). Seeds should sprout in 7-14 days.","Sow 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep in rows spaced 60cm (24″) apart, and thin to 15-20cm (6-8″) apart in the row.","Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Humus-rich, deeply cultivated soil is key. Add plenty of well rotted compost or manure to the beds and cultivate to a depth of 20cm (8″). Dig in 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer for every 3m (10′) of row. The real secret to success with turnips is speed. Sow short rows every 2-3 weeks, thin them quickly, keep them watered, harvest, and then sow some more. GerminationAt least 80% of seeds will germinate in optimal conditions. Usual seed life: 4 years. Per 100′ row: 300 seeds, per acre: 87M seeds.",Gather greens and roots throughout summer as needed. Their immature seed pods are also tasty.
Leek,Vegetable,"Start summer/fall harvest leeks 6-8 weeks before the last frost date, in flats indoors. Start winter harvest leeks indoors from March to mid-June. In mild winter areas, start them in a humus-rich nursery bed outside, and then transplant. Optimal soil temperature: 10-25°C (50-75°F). Seeds should sprout in 10-16 days.","In flats: Sow seeds 5mm (¼”) deep, about 1cm (½”) apart. Transplant when 20cm (8″) tall. Space 20cm (8″) apart in rows 45cm (18″) apart. Rows can be as narrow as 20cm (8"") if planting in raised beds or other situation where weeding will be simple.","Ideal pH: 5.-6.5. Leeks have short roots, so the benefit from fertile soil with lots of compost and ½ cup\xa0balanced organic fertilizer worked in beneath each 2m (6′) of row. Traditional garden wisdom recommends using a dibber to make holes 15cm (6″) deep. Transplants are then set at the bottom of the hole and the hole is left unfilled – rain will fill it in as the leek grows. To blanch further up the stem, hill soil up around the stem as the leek grows, or mulch with straw.However, the wise and much loved garden writer Linda Gilkeson asserts that there is no need to plant leeks into holes or trenches. She recommends transplanting the seedlings only at the depth of the soil plug they grow in. They will still produce nice, tall, blanched shanks, with no soil grains between the leaves.In late fall, mulch around leeks as high up the stems as possible. If the forecast is for weather below -10°‚ cover them with a blanket or tarp. GerminationDays to maturity: From transplant date.In optimal conditions at least 65% of seeds will germinate. Usual seed life: 1 year. Per 100′ row: 240 seeds, per acre: 70M seeds.","Dig at any size, as needed. If winter harvest leeks freeze solid, wait until they thaw out during a warm spell to harvest."
